**Date:** 2025-12-20  

**Constraints you gave**

- Beds: **75–80 ft long × 30 in wide**
- Shade cloth + warmth cloth available
- Preference:
  - **Unmixed salads** (single-variety lettuce, etc.) → **transplant**
  - **Mixed greens** (Ovation, baby-greens mixes) → **direct sow**

## Cauliflower note

Cauliflower can do well, but it’s one of the more **demanding** cool-season crops because:

- **Narrow “happy zone”**: it needs steady growth. If it stalls (cold snap, dry spell, nutrient dip), heads can be small or “ricey.”
- **Heat sensitivity**: inland SoCal can get warm spells even in late winter/early spring; cauliflower often reacts with poor curd quality.
- **Water sensitivity**: it’s truly **High water** for quality. Moisture swings = stress.
- **Timing pressure**: it’s slower than many brassicas, so a late start pushes harvest into warmer weather.

**When it’s worth it anyway:** if you want cauliflower, you’ll usually get the best results by:

- starting in trays (not direct sow),
- transplanting on time,
- keeping moisture + fertility consistent,
- and using **shade cloth** during warm spells.

## Timeline

### A) Start seedlings (begin Dec 27)

#### Seedlings table: days from sowing to transplant

Typical ranges; adjust for light/temp/tray size.

| Seed (species) | Start method | Typical days to transplant | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Celery | trays | **70–90** | slow; keep evenly moist; steady growth matters |
| Onions (from seed) | trays | **60–90** | transplant as pencil-thick seedlings |
| Broccoli | trays | **28–45** | forgiving; great winter crop |
| Cabbage / Napa / Pak choi | trays | **28–45** | steady water improves quality |
| Cauliflower | trays | **30–45** | most sensitive; avoid stress; shade cloth on warm spells |
| Kale | trays | **25–40** | also fine direct-sown, but transplanting is tidy |
| Lettuce (single varieties) | trays | **21–35** | matches your “unmixed salads = transplant” preference |
| Swiss chard | trays (optional) | **21–35** | direct sow also fine |
| Mustard greens | trays (optional) | **14–28** | often easiest direct-sown unless you want precise spacing |
| Chicory | trays (optional) | **21–35** | slower than lettuce; transplanting gives uniformity |

#### Seedling-start list (Dec 27)

- Celery (Golden Pascal, Tango)
- Onions (Red Rock, Maragogi)

### B) Direct sow in beds (Jan 10–15)

#### Direct sow list (Jan 10–15)

##### Roots (preferred direct sow)

- Beets (Golden, Boro, Detroit, Bulls Blood, Boldor)
- Carrots (Juwarot, Miami pelleted, Nantes Coreless, Danvers, Bengala)
- Radishes (French Breakfast, Confetti mix)
- **Turnips** *(add to inventory; direct sow is standard)*

##### Mixed baby greens (your preference)

- Zone 9–10 lettuce mix (SDSC)
- Allstar Gourmet lettuce mix (JS)
- Ovation greens mix (JS)

##### Herbs (best direct sown)

- Cilantro (Leisure; Calypso) — succession sow every 2–3 weeks if you want steady harvest
- Dill (Bouquet)
- Parsley (Flat Leaf Italian) *(slow germination, but fine)*

##### Cool-season legumes

- **Peas (snow/snap/shelling)** *(add to inventory; direct sow with trellis)*  
- Fava beans (Oct–Dec is prime; early Jan can still work)

##### Cool-season flowers (beds/edges)

- Poppies (CA poppy + mixes)
- Larkspur
- Nigella
- Sweet peas (flowering; needs trellis)

## Suggested “bed assignment” starter plan (simple)

### Pattern 1: Brassica bed (transplants)

- 1 row down center, 18\" spacing  
- Crops: broccoli / cabbage / cauliflower / kale

### Pattern 2: Head-lettuce bed (transplants)

- 2 rows, 10–12\" spacing  
- Crops: single-variety lettuces (e.g., Parris Island Cos)

### Pattern 3: Baby greens bed (direct sow mixes)

- broadcast 8–12\" strip down center (or 2–3 narrow bands)  
- Crops: Ovation mix, Allstar mix, Zone 9–10 mix  
- Harvest: cut-and-come-again

### Pattern 4: Root bed (direct sow)

- carrots in 2–3 bands; keep surface moist until germination  
- beets in 1–2 bands  
- radish as quick gap-filler

### Pattern 5: Pea bed (direct sow + trellis)

- 1 row next to trellis; sow thickly, thin later

## Notes

- **Cauliflower**: steady water + fertility; shade cloth on warm spells; don’t let it stall.
- **Carrots**: keep the top 1/2\" moist until germination; warmth cloth can help with wind + humidity.
- **Baby greens**: easiest win; sow every 2–3 weeks for steady harvest.
- **Lettuce transplants**: tidy beds + consistent spacing (fits your preference).
