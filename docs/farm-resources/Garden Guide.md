# Garden Guide

## Soil Preparation

- Plants prefer deeply worked, composted, and well-drained soil with a slightly acidic pH
- Dig or till in amendments and rake to create a smooth, level seed bed
- Test soil yearly, and amend as needed

## Direct Sowing

- If you are fertilizing at time of planting, band the fertilizer deeper than the seed will be planted
- Dig a shallow furrow to mark the row
- Plant your seed to the appropriate depth (see specific vegetables for measurements)
- Cover seed with soil, vermiculite, or sifted compost
- Water in and keep the soil evenly moist during germination; avoid soggy soil to prevent rotting
- Thin seedlings when there are 1-2 sets of true leaves (see specific vegetables for final spacing)

## Indoor Seeding

- Always start with new and/or sanitized potting supplies and a sterile, soilless, seed starting medium to avoid damping-off, a devastating fungal disease
- **Note:** To sanitize trays or pots use a mild bleach solution and rinse well
- Start seeds in trays or individual 3-4 inch pots
- Plant your seed to the appropriate depth (see specific vegetables for measurements)
- For fine seed, lightly press the seed into a pre-watered medium so that it has good contact with the soil
- For best results, plant 2-3 seeds per cell/pot
- Water in without washing away the seed
- Keep evenly moist during germination
- Use propagation domes during germination and remove after seedlings have emerged
- To maintain proper soil temperatures for germination use heat mats or soil heating cables
- Adequate light (full sun or direct artificial) is key while seedlings are developing - if seedlings are stretching and spindly looking, they are often reaching for light
- Thin cells/pots to strongest plant
- To prevent damping off, do not over water, but do provide adequate air flow around seedlings
- During development apply a foliar spray of liquid fertilizer like Age Old Grow diluted to 1/4 strength

## Transplanting

- Starts are ready for transplant when they are well developed, but before they are root bound
- Harden-off transplants by gradually exposing them to full sun and outside temperatures (this generally takes several days)
- As a general rule, most warm-weather transplants go out after the threat of frost has passed
- Veggies such as lettuce and brassicas are more cool tolerant than tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants
- See specific vegetables for plant spacing
- Keep the soil level the same on the stem of the plant, so it's not too deep or too shallow (tomatoes are an exception)
- Irrigate well to ensure roots do not dry out

## Cultivation

- Use floating row covers to protect young plants from low evening temperatures, especially early in the season
- **Note:** Be watchful for early hot spells: covers can create too much heat if left unchecked
- Keep watered and weed free
- **Note:** Irrigate the soil and avoid wetting the leaves to help reduce fungal issues
- For early and mid season fertilizing, we recommend Age Old Grow or TSC's Complete Fertilizer
- For fruiting plants we recommend a fertilizer higher in phosphorus, such as Age Old Bloom, to encourage flowering/fruiting - excess nitrogen may cause excess foliage and poor fruit set

## Insects, Pests and Diseases

- Strong, healthy plants can best withstand pest and disease pressure

**Common insect controls:**

- Pyrethrin and predatory insects such as Ladybugs are good for adult insect infestations
- Monterey B.t. specifically targets caterpillars and chewing worms

**Common insect prevention:**

- Predatory nematodes will attack almost any insect that has part of its life cycle underground

**Common disease control:**

- Fungal diseases such as molds and mildews can be controlled with Zonix or Neem

**Common disease prevention:**

- Proper crop rotations (see each vegetable for recommendations)
- Practice good garden sanitation by making sure any diseased plant material is either thrown away or burned (**not** composted)
- At the end of the season, once crops are expired, remove all plants from the garden
- Select disease-resistant varieties if diseases are persistent
- Diseases vary by region, so it is always a good idea to contact your local extension office with questions for your area

## Harvest & Storage

- It is important to harvest crops at proper maturity for peak flavor and nutrition
- Avoid damaging or bruising produce
- Use clean, sanitized tools and containers
- Harvest when weather is cool, especially for leafy greens
- Chill promptly to maintain flavor and extend storage life (except for tomatoes)
- Thoroughly wash and rinse immediately prior to use
