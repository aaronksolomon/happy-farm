At its core the happy farm is about happiness not farming. More than the superficial happiness of 'pleasant' this is the deep happiness that has the capacity to hold and transform suffering. Radical means rooted and the Happy Farm is a radical expression of Thay's deep vision for a thriving humanity grounded in interbeing. The Happy Farm has Community building at its core: happiness for communities of human and non-human elements within and beyond the monastery -\> building a strong community networked out beyond the monastery -\> a radical new model of land food production and land stewardship through relationships -\> mindfulness foundation -\> a living classroom to directly experience interbeing and to re-establish natural cycles like nutrient cycle, air-water cycles: carbon sequestration, humanure composting, predator prey cycles, letting natural systems run -\> rewilding and reclaiming the best parts of our human heritage and ancestry, honoring re-learning indigenous wisdom, restoring right relation with the more than human world. Visions that we will build on: Wendel Berry, Robin Wall Kimmerer

## **Opening Frame**

**The Happy Farm is rooted in happiness; the food from the farm is rooted in that happiness.**

-   Not superficial \"pleasant\" --- the deep happiness that holds and transforms suffering

-   **Radical** means **rooted** --- Thay\'s vision for thriving humanity grounded in interbeing

## **Three Foundations**

### **1. Community at the Core**

-   Building happiness for communities: human AND non-human

-   Within the monastery AND networked beyond

-   A new model of land stewardship **through relationships** = **natural sustainability**

### **2. Mindfulness as Living Practice**

-   A **living classroom and model**. Where we can directly experience interbeing

-   Re-establishing natural cycles we\'ve broken:

    -   Nutrient cycles (humanure composting)

    -   Not disturbing soil cycles -\> Carbon sequestration as benefit

    -   Predator-prey balance

    -   Water-air cycles

-   **Letting natural systems run**

### **3. Ancestral Reclamation and Regenerative Agriculture**

-   Rewilding land and hearts, reclaiming the best parts of our human heritage

-   Honoring and re-learning indigenous wisdom

-   Restoring **right relationship** with the more-than-human world**.**
