# **Happy Farm Watering Info**

*Deer Park Monastery - Escondido, CA\
Updated: July 2025*

## **Overview**

Possible watering strategies for our 36 raised bed system using drip tape irrigation. Current mild weather (morning fog, 80°F peaks, 60°F nights) creates ideal growing conditions with lower water stress than typical conditions.

**General Watering Strategies & Principles**

### **Core Principles**

-   **Consistency over frequency** - Deep, regular watering beats shallow daily watering

-   **Early morning timing** - 5-7 AM reduces disease pressure and water loss

-   **Plant observation** - Watch plants, not just schedules

-   **Soil depth monitoring** - Check moisture 2-6 inches deep, not just surface

-   **Group by water needs** - Similar crops can share watering schedules

### **Environmental Factors**

-   **Morning fog** - Natural humidity reduces plant water stress

-   **Mild temperatures** - Lower evapotranspiration than hot inland areas

-   **Mulched beds** - Significantly reduces water loss and soil temperature

-   **Well-draining raised beds** - Allows deep watering without waterlogging

## **Water System Calculations**

### **Drip Tape Specifications**

-   **Tape:** Irritec P1 Drip Tape, 5/8\", 15 mil wall

-   **Emitter spacing:** 6 inches

-   **Flow rate:** 0.25 GPH per emitter

-   **Lines per row:** 3 lines

-   **Row dimensions:** 75 ft × 30 inches

### **Water Application Rates**

-   **Per linear foot:** 3 lines × 0.25 GPH × 2 emitters = **1.5 GPH per foot**

-   **Per 75ft row:** 112.5 gallons per hour

-   **30-minute run:** 56.25 gallons per row

-   **45-minute run:** 84.4 gallons per row

-   **60-minute run:** 112.5 gallons per row

### **Coverage Pattern**

-   6-inch emitter spacing creates overlapping moisture zones

-   Excellent for even water distribution

-   Supports deep root development

-   Ideal for preventing dry spots between plants

## **Crop-Specific Watering Schedules**

### **HIGH WATER NEEDS (Every 1-2 days)**

**Crops:** Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Zucchini, Basil

-   **Frequency:** Daily during fruit set/harvest, every other day in mild weather

-   **Duration:** 45-60 minutes (67-90 gallons per row)

-   **Timing:** Early morning (5-7 AM)

-   **Special notes:** Deep watering better than frequent shallow

### **MEDIUM-HIGH WATER NEEDS (Every 2-3 days)**

**Crops:** Eggplant, Collards, Kale, Broccoli

-   **Frequency:** Every 2-3 days depending on weather

-   **Duration:** 30-45 minutes (45-67 gallons per row)

-   **Timing:** Early morning

-   **Special notes:** Brassicas prefer consistent moisture, avoid wet-dry cycles

### **MEDIUM WATER NEEDS (Every 3-4 days)**

**Crops:** Beets, Carrots, Bush Beans

-   **Frequency:** Every 3-4 days

-   **Duration:** 20-30 minutes (30-45 gallons per row)

-   **Timing:** Early morning

-   **Special notes:** Root crops need consistent but moderate water

### **LOWER WATER NEEDS (1-2 times per week)**

**Crops:** Hot Peppers (once established)

-   **Frequency:** 1-2 times per week

-   **Duration:** 20-30 minutes for deep penetration

-   **Special notes:** Slight water stress improves pepper heat and flavor

## **Weekly Watering Schedule**

### **Monday, Wednesday, Friday**

-   High-need crops (tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, basil)

-   Medium-high crops if showing stress signs

### **Tuesday, Saturday**

-   Medium-high crops (eggplant, brassicas)

-   Medium crops (beets, carrots, beans)

### **Thursday**

-   Hot peppers

-   Any stressed plants requiring attention

### **Sunday**

-   **Assessment day** - check soil moisture, observe plants, adjust schedule

-   No routine watering - planning and observation

## **Tomato Ripening & Watering Strategy**

### **Understanding Tomato Water Needs**

**Growth vs. Ripening Phases:**

-   **Flowering/fruit set:** Consistent water critical (prevents blossom drop, blossom end rot)

-   **Fruit development:** High water demand (tomatoes are 95% water)

-   **Final ripening:** Reduced water concentrates flavors and sugars

**The Consistency Principle:**

-   Tomatoes need **consistent** water, not necessarily **more** water

-   Wet-dry cycles cause cracking, blossom end rot, and stress

-   Deep watering 2-3x per week \> shallow daily watering

### **Ripening Science (Green → Red)**

**Primary Factor: Temperature**

-   **Optimal range:** 68-77°F (perfect for Escondido conditions)

-   **Below 60°F:** Ripening slows dramatically

-   **Above 85°F:** Lycopene production stops (tomatoes stay yellow/orange)

-   **Current forecast (76-83°F):** Ideal ripening conditions

**Secondary Factors:**

-   **Ethylene gas:** Naturally produced by fruit, accelerates ripening

-   **Light:** Common myth - light doesn\'t ripen tomatoes, warmth does

-   **Nutrients:** Minimal benefit during ripening phase, stop feeding full-sized fruit

### **Water Strategy During Ripening**

**For Full-Sized Green Tomatoes:**

-   **Reduce water by 25-30%** (concentrate sugars and flavors)

-   **Maintain consistency** (prevent cracking)

-   **Recommended timing:** Every 3 days, 30-35 minutes instead of 45-60 minutes

**Warning Signs:**

-   **Too little:** Morning wilting, fruit cracking, blossom end rot on new fruits

-   **Too much:** Diluted flavor, increased disease risk, delayed ripening

### **Vine Ripening vs. Early Harvest**

**Vine Ripening Advantages:**

-   **Superior flavor** - complex sugars and acids develop fully

-   **Better texture** - natural cell structure

-   **Peak nutrition** - higher lycopene and vitamin C

-   **Natural timing** - fruit decides optimal harvest

**When to Harvest Early:**

-   Bird/pest pressure

-   Disease risk (late blight, cracking from rain)

-   Extreme weather conditions

-   End of season harvest

**Optimal Harvest Timing:**

-   **\"Breaker\" stage** (first blush of pink) - 95% of vine-ripened flavor, reduced risk

-   **Full vine ripening** - maximum flavor, requires daily monitoring

**Current Conditions:** Perfect for vine ripening! Continue current approach with ideal 76-83°F weather.

## **Monitoring Techniques**

### **Daily Observations**

-   **Visual inspection:** Leaf turgidity, wilting signs, growth vigor

-   **Soil finger test:** 2-3 inches deep near plants

-   **Mulch check:** Pull back to see soil moisture underneath

### **Weekly Assessments**

-   **Deep soil probe:** Check moisture at 6-8 inch root depth

-   **Plant stress indicators:** Leaf curl, color changes, growth patterns

-   **System performance:** Check for clogged emitters, pressure issues

### **Seasonal Adjustments**

-   **Current (July-August):** Follow above schedule

-   **Fall transition (September):** Reduce frequency by 25-30%

-   **Winter:** 1-2x per week for most crops

## **Quick Reference: Current Optimal Schedule**

**High-need crops (tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, basil):**

-   Every 3 days, 45 minutes (ripening tomatoes: 30-35 minutes)

**Medium-high crops (eggplant, brassicas):**

-   Every 2-3 days, 30-45 minutes

**Medium crops (beets, carrots, beans):**

-   Every 3-4 days, 20-30 minutes

**Peppers:**

-   1-2x per week, 20-30 minutes

**Timing:** Early morning (5-7 AM) for all crops

*Monitor closely and adjust based on plant response. Our mild Escondido climate provides ideal learning conditions with lower stress margins for irrigation adjustments.*

\[HUMAN\]:

OK, we\'re working on taking care of this farm now, a small group of us are the (inexperienced) lead farmers after 1 key farmer had to take a break.

What we have planted (75ft rows, 30in, about 36 raised rows) some mulch down in beds.

Kale (standard)

Egg-plant

Tomatoes (trellised, line-suspended)

Collard Greens

Broccoli (some bolted to flower and seed)

Beets

Basil (Asian + Italian)

Carrots

Cucumbers (typical climbing, line suspended)

Hot peppers (unknown variety)

Bush Beans

Zucchini

we are at July 20, our Escondido, CA weather has been very mild this summer, with full sun (morning fog cloud cover) but peak temps in the low 80\'s, nights in mid 60s.

We have drip tape, 3 lines per row, here\'s the spec.

Irritec P1 Drip Tape - 5/8\" - Wall Thickness : 15 mil - Emitter Spacing : 6\" - Flow Rate : 0.25 GPH - Roll Length : 3,600\'

A key question right now is a developing and programming our watering schedule. Can you do some analysis and provide some suggestions for each plant type?

\[CLAUDE\]:

This is a great practical question about irrigation scheduling for a Happy Farm (as I can see from the documents - this is at Deer Park Monastery). Let me analyze the situation:

Current Context:

Location: Escondido, CA (San Diego County, Mediterranean climate)

Date: July 20, 2025

Weather: Mild summer, highs low 80s, lows mid 60s, morning fog

Infrastructure: Drip tape with 6\" spacing, 0.25 GPH emitters, 3 lines per 30\" wide row

Crop mix: Various vegetables at different stages

Team: Inexperienced lead farmers after key farmer took break

Drip Tape Analysis:

5/8\" drip tape, 15 mil thickness (medium duty)

6\" emitter spacing = 12 emitters per 6-foot section

0.25 GPH per emitter

3 lines per 30\" row = 3 parallel tapes

Let me calculate water application rates:

Per linear foot: 2 emitters × 0.25 GPH = 0.5 GPH per tape

Per row (3 tapes): 1.5 GPH per linear foot

For 75-foot rows: 112.5 GPH per row when running

Irrigation Scheduling Considerations:

Crop water needs (varies by plant type and growth stage)

Soil type and drainage (from documents, seems like they\'ve been adding compost)

Weather conditions (mild temps, morning fog = lower evapotranspiration)

Root depth and spread

Growth stage of each crop

Plant Categories by Water Needs:

High water: Tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, basil

Medium-high: Eggplant, collards, kale, broccoli

Medium: Beets, carrots, bush beans

Lower: Hot peppers (once established)

I\'ll develop a practical irrigation strategy focusing on targeted watering approaches. The key is creating a flexible schedule that adapts to each crop\'s specific needs. I\'ll design a tiered watering system that considers plant water requirements, growth stages, and local climate conditions. This means shorter, more frequent watering for high-water crops and less frequent, deeper watering for established lower-water plants like hot peppers.

Monitoring will be critical. I recommend using soil moisture sensors, visual plant inspections, and tracking daily weather conditions to fine-tune the irrigation schedule. The inexperienced team should create a simple log to track watering times, plant responses, and environmental factors.Looking at your setup and crops, I can help you develop a watering schedule. Let me break this down by analyzing your drip system capacity and each crop\'s needs.

Drip System Analysis

Your water application rate:

3 lines × 0.25 GPH × 12 emitters per 6ft = 1.5 GPH per linear foot

For 75ft rows: 112.5 gallons per hour per row

This is quite generous - good for establishing plants but you\'ll want to optimize timing

Watering Schedule by Crop Category

HIGH WATER NEEDS (Daily in heat, every other day in mild weather)

Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Zucchini, Basil

Frequency: Daily during fruit set/harvest, every other day otherwise

Duration: 45-60 minutes (67-90 gallons per row)

Timing: Early morning (5-7 AM) to reduce disease pressure

Notes: Deep, less frequent better than shallow daily for tomatoes

MEDIUM-HIGH WATER NEEDS (Every 2-3 days)

Eggplant, Collards, Kale, Broccoli

Frequency: Every 2-3 days depending on weather

Duration: 30-45 minutes (45-67 gallons per row)

Timing: Early morning

Notes: Brassicas (kale, collards, broccoli) prefer consistent moisture

MEDIUM WATER NEEDS (Every 3-4 days)

Beets, Carrots, Bush Beans

Frequency: Every 3-4 days

Duration: 20-30 minutes (30-45 gallons per row)

Timing: Early morning

Notes: Root crops need consistent but not excessive water

LOWER WATER NEEDS (Weekly deep watering)

Hot Peppers (once established)

Frequency: 1-2 times per week

Duration: 20-30 minutes for deep penetration

Notes: Peppers actually produce better with slight stress

Recommended Weekly Schedule

Monday, Wednesday, Friday:

High-need crops (tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, basil)

Medium-high crops if showing stress

Tuesday, Saturday:

Medium-high crops (eggplant, brassicas)

Medium crops (beets, carrots, beans)

Thursday:

Hot peppers

Any stressed plants

Sunday:

Assessment day - check soil moisture, adjust schedule

Monitoring Techniques

Finger test: Stick finger 2-3 inches into soil near plants

Mulch check: Pull back mulch to see soil moisture underneath

Plant observation: Wilting in early morning = needs water

Soil probe: Simple tool to check moisture at root depth

Seasonal Adjustments for Escondido

Current (July-August): Above schedule works well

Fall transition (September): Reduce frequency by 25-30%

Winter: May only need 1-2x per week for most crops

Quick Start Recommendations

This week: Start with every-other-day for all crops, 30-45 minutes

Monitor closely: Check soil moisture daily for first week

Adjust based on observation: Some crops may need more/less

Group by needs: Consider replumbing zones by water requirements if possible

The mild weather you\'re experiencing is actually ideal for learning irrigation - less stress on plants if you make mistakes. Your morning fog is also helping reduce water stress significantly.

Would you like me to help you set up a simple monitoring log to track which adjustments work best for your specific conditions?

\[HUMAN\]:

why do tomatoes need more water? I\'d heard they do not like to be over watered, but perhaps during fruit set, this is more important?

\[CLAUDE\]:

This is a great question that gets to some nuanced understanding about tomato watering. The user is right to be confused because there are seemingly contradictory statements about tomato watering. Let me think through this:

Tomatoes don\'t like to be \"overwatered\" in the sense of:

Waterlogged/soggy soil (causes root rot, disease)

Inconsistent watering (causes blossom end rot, cracking)

Shallow frequent watering (causes shallow root systems)

But tomatoes DO need a lot of water because:

They\'re large plants with big leaf surface area (high transpiration)

They\'re producing heavy, water-dense fruits

During fruit development, water demand spikes significantly

The key distinction is:

DEEP, CONSISTENT watering = good

FREQUENT, SHALLOW or INCONSISTENT = bad

During fruit set specifically:

Water stress can cause blossom drop

Inconsistent water causes blossom end rot

Adequate water needed for fruit expansion

Let me clarify this for the user because it\'s a really important distinction for successful tomato growing.You\'re absolutely right to question this! It\'s a nuanced distinction that confuses many gardeners. Let me clarify:

Tomatoes Need CONSISTENT Water, Not Necessarily MORE Water

What tomatoes hate:

Inconsistent watering (wet-dry cycles) → causes blossom end rot, fruit cracking

Waterlogged soil → root rot, disease, poor fruit quality

Shallow frequent watering → weak surface roots, stressed plants

What tomatoes love:

Deep, consistent moisture → strong root system, steady growth

Well-draining soil that stays evenly moist → healthy roots

Predictable water supply → prevents stress responses

The Fruit Set Connection

You\'re spot on about fruit set being critical:

During flowering/early fruit set:

Water stress → blossom drop (plant abandons flowers to survive)

Inconsistent water → blossom end rot (calcium can\'t move properly)

Adequate consistent water → good fruit set and development

During fruit development:

Large water demand for fruit expansion (tomatoes are 95% water)

Irregular watering → splitting/cracking as fruits expand unevenly

The Real Principle: Deep & Consistent vs. Frequent & Shallow

Better approach for tomatoes:

Water deeply 2-3x per week rather than lightly every day

Aim for soil moisture 6-8 inches deep

Let top inch dry between watings, but keep subsoil moist

For your drip system:

45-60 minutes every other day is likely perfect

This gives deep penetration without waterlogging

Much better than 15 minutes daily

Quick Test for Your Setup

Check soil moisture at different depths after watering:

2 inches: Should dry out between waterings

4-6 inches: Should stay consistently moist

8+ inches: Should have good moisture reserves

Your drip tape spacing (6\" emitters) actually creates ideal conditions for this deep, even watering pattern tomatoes prefer.

So you\'re right to be cautious about \"overwatering\" - the key is consistent deep watering rather than frequency!

\[HUMAN\]:

What about the final stages of ripening when tomatoes are full sized but still green? is less water helpful then? or hotter conditions, or more direct light? what\'s optimal for the yellow-\>ripe red phase? do nutrients help?

\[CLAUDE\]:

This is a great question about the final ripening stage of tomatoes. Let me think through the physiology of tomato ripening and what factors actually drive it:

Ripening is primarily driven by ethylene gas production and temperature, not water or nutrients

The fruit has already reached full size, so it\'s not expanding anymore

Water stress can actually concentrate flavors but too much stress can cause problems

Light doesn\'t directly ripen tomatoes - it\'s about temperature and ethylene

Nutrients at this stage are less important since the fruit is basically done growing

Let me break this down properly\...Excellent question! This is where tomato physiology gets really interesting. The ripening phase is quite different from the growth phase.

What Actually Drives Ripening (Green → Red)

Primary driver: Temperature

Optimal ripening: 68-77°F (20-25°C)

Below 60°F: Ripening slows dramatically

Above 85°F: Lycopene production stops (stay yellow/orange)

Your mild 80°F Escondido weather is actually perfect!

Secondary driver: Ethylene gas

Produced naturally by the fruit

Concentrated in enclosed/warm spaces

Why tomatoes ripen faster in paper bags

Water Strategy During Final Ripening

Reduce water by 25-30% once fruits are full-sized:

Concentrates sugars and flavors

Prevents diluted taste from excess water uptake

Still maintain consistency to prevent cracking

For your system: Maybe 30-35 minutes instead of 45-60

Signs you\'ve reduced too much:

Wilting during morning hours

Fruit cracking/splitting

Blossom end rot on new fruits

Light vs. Heat Clarification

Common myth: Direct sunlight ripens tomatoes

Reality:

Light doesn\'t directly ripen fruit

Too much direct sun can actually sunscald green tomatoes

It\'s the warmth that matters, not the light

Fruits can ripen perfectly in shade if temperature is right

Nutrients During Ripening

Minimal benefit from additional feeding:

Fruit has already accumulated most nutrients during growth phase

Excess nitrogen can actually delay ripening

Potassium and calcium were important earlier but less so now

Best approach: Stop feeding once fruits are full-sized

Optimal Strategy for Your Setup

Reduce watering frequency slightly (every 3 days vs. every 2)

Maintain your current temperatures (perfect range)

Stop fertilizing full-sized green tomatoes

Harvest timing: Pick when first blush of color appears, ripen indoors at 70°F

Advanced Ripening Tricks

To speed ripening:

Harvest mature green, ripen in 70°F room

Place with ripe apple/banana (ethylene producers)

Gentle stress (slight water reduction)

To slow ripening:

Keep at 60-65°F

Increase air circulation

Harvest just before full red

Your mild Escondido conditions are actually ideal - many hot climate growers struggle with the \>85°F cutoff for lycopene production. You\'re in the sweet spot!

\[HUMAN\]:

ah. so picking tomatoes before they turn red on the vine? what about vine ripening? improved taste or? we\'ve been letting them vine ripen to almost full red. we should let them continue to ripen by storing at 70 degrees?

our forcast:

today 77

mon 76

tues 78

wed 80

thu 83

fri 80

sat 76

sun 77

mon 82

looks like perfect tomato weather. Watering every three days for 45 minutes sounds good?

\[CLAUDE\]:

The user is asking about whether to pick tomatoes before red vs letting them vine ripen, and about the taste differences. They\'re also asking about their watering schedule given their weather forecast.

Let me think about this:

Vine ripening vs. off-vine ripening - there are pros and cons to each

Their weather forecast is indeed excellent for tomato ripening - all temps in the 76-83°F range which is perfect

The watering schedule they propose (every 3 days, 45 minutes) sounds reasonable for the ripening stage

For vine ripening vs picking early:

Vine ripening generally does produce better flavor and texture

But there are practical considerations like bird damage, cracking, disease pressure

The optimal time to pick is usually at \"breaker\" stage (first blush of color)

Full vine ripening is better if conditions allow

Their weather forecast is absolutely perfect for vine ripening - all temps in the ideal 68-77°F range (though a couple days pushing toward 80-83 which is still fine).

The watering schedule of every 3 days for 45 minutes during this ripening phase with their weather sounds very reasonable.You\'re absolutely right to question this! There\'s definitely a taste advantage to vine ripening when conditions allow.

Vine Ripening vs. Off-Vine: The Trade-offs

Vine ripening advantages:

Superior flavor - complex sugars and acids develop fully

Better texture - cell structure stays intact

Peak nutrition - higher lycopene and vitamin C

Natural timing - fruit decides when it\'s ready

When to pick early instead:

Bird/pest pressure (major issue in many areas)

Disease risk (late blight, cracking from rain)

Extreme weather (heat waves \>85°F or cold snaps)

End of season harvest

Your Situation: Perfect for Vine Ripening!

Your forecast is absolutely ideal:

76-83°F = perfect ripening range

No extreme heat that stops lycopene

No rain forecast to cause cracking

Consistent mild conditions

Recommendation: Keep vine ripening with your current approach! You\'re in tomato paradise.

Optimal Harvest Timing for Best of Both

Pick at \"breaker\" stage (first blush of pink/yellow):

95% of vine-ripened flavor

Reduced risk of bird damage

Still ripen perfectly at room temp

Best compromise approach

Full vine ripening (your current method):

Maximum flavor potential

Watch for overripeness/soft spots

Harvest daily during peak season

Your Watering Plan: Spot On

Every 3 days, 45 minutes sounds perfect for:

Your ideal weather conditions

Ripening stage water reduction

Maintaining consistency without overdoing it

Monitor for:

Any morning wilting (increase frequency)

Fruit cracking (reduce duration)

Your plants will tell you if they\'re happy

The Bottom Line

With your perfect ripening weather, keep doing what you\'re doing! Your vine-ripened tomatoes will likely taste significantly better than anything store-bought. The slight water reduction will concentrate flavors even more.

Only consider early picking if you start seeing bird damage or disease pressure. Otherwise, enjoy that perfect Escondido tomato-growing climate!
