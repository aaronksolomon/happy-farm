# **Spencer\'s Farming Advice - Sage Hill Farms Consultation**

*Key takeaways from conversation with Spencer, local organic farmer (1 mile from Happy Farm)*

## **SOIL NUTRITION & FERTILIZERS**

### **The Nitrogen Reality Check**

-   **Compost alone is not enough nitrogen** for most crops

-   Spencer observed this directly at Happy Farm: collards in front row (where fertilizer bag was accidentally dropped) were much larger than those without

-   **Variability in crop size** across rows is often due to uneven nitrogen distribution

-   Nitrogen is **volatile and evaporates** - must be covered/worked into soil, not left on surface

### **Fertilizer Recommendations**

**Primary Options (in order of team preference):**

1.  **Alfalfa meal** - 100% plant-based, no ethical concerns

2.  **TruFord 12-0-0** (or similar) - Blend of bone meal, fish meal, kelp meal (byproducts)

3.  **Bone meal** - Higher potassium/phosphorus for fruiting plants

### **Application Method & Timing**

1.  **Apply nitrogen first** (half of 5-gallon bucket per 75ft row = \~2.5 gallons)

2.  **Add compost layer on top**

3.  **Broad fork** to incorporate

4.  **Scuffle hoe** the surface

5.  **Rake smooth**

**Apply before every new crop planting** - this is not optional for good yields

## **IRRIGATION SYSTEMS**

### **Spencer\'s Strong Preference: Overhead vs Drip**

**Why Spencer doesn\'t recommend drip tape:**

-   **Spot irrigation problems** - roots only grow where water is, missing nutrients in dry zones

-   **Maintenance intensive** - constant repairs, moving lines daily

-   **Plastic waste** - frequent replacement needs

-   **System failures** - one cut line compromises entire connected system

-   **Transplant challenges** - plugs die if not placed exactly on emitters

**Overhead irrigation advantages:**

-   **Complete soil saturation** - roots spread in all directions

-   **Visual confirmation** - can see everything is being watered

-   **Cooling effect** - cools plants and soil surface

-   **Less maintenance** - fewer moving parts and repairs

-   **Better for transplants** - no precision placement needed

### **Watering Schedule Differences**

-   **Spencer\'s system:** 30 minutes daily (overhead), twice daily for tomatoes

-   **Your current system:** 40-50 minutes every 3 days (drip) - Spencer surprised this works

-   **For transplants:** Must switch to overhead for first 2 weeks, twice daily

## **SEASONAL PLANTING STRATEGY**

### **Current Timing (July-August)**

**Plant NOW for fall harvest (September-December):**

-   All brassicas: broccoli, kale, cabbages, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts

-   These crops handle heat during establishment, thrive in fall temperatures

-   **Timeline:** 65-75 days from seed to harvest (increases as daylight decreases)

### **The Seasonal Rhythm**

-   **Peak summer (July-August):** Like \"dead winter with snow\" - too hot for most planting

-   **Fall (September-December):** Like \"spring in reverse\" - ideal growing conditions

-   **Sweet spot:** 70°F temperatures, slower plant growth = extended harvest window

-   **Winter advantage:** Crops \"sit still\" in field, providing leisurely harvest period

### **Planning Mindset**

**\"Always think 1-2 months ahead\"** - What do you want to harvest in October? Plant it now.

## **TRANSPLANT & SEEDLING CARE**

### **Critical First Two Weeks**

-   **Water twice daily:** 30 minutes morning + 15-20 minutes at 2 PM

-   **Use overhead irrigation** - drip won\'t reach transplant roots

-   **Cover with shade cloth** for protection

-   **Remove drip lines** while running overhead to avoid over-watering

### **The Root Development Issue**

-   Transplant plugs have no extended root system initially

-   Must establish roots before drip system becomes effective

-   **Two-week transition period** is essential for survival

## **SHADE CLOTH SYSTEM**

### **Materials Needed**

-   **30% shade cloth** (10ft x 100ft purchased)

-   **9-gauge wire hoops** - buy chain link \"top wire\" from Home Depot

-   **Cut wire once** with grinder to create perfect hoops

-   **\$70 for two rolls** - covers multiple rows

### **Setup & Usage**

-   **Hoop spacing:** Every few feet along bed

-   **Cover new plantings** for first 2 weeks in summer heat

-   **Protects seeds and transplants** from soil temperature extremes

-   **Essential for summer planting success**

## **TOMATO MANAGEMENT**

### **Current Status Assessment**

-   Massive harvest currently happening ✓

-   **Problem:** Not many new flowers forming = need nutrition input

### **Nutrition for Continued Production**

-   **Apply bone meal** - higher potassium/phosphorus (approximately 2-15-10 NPK)

-   **Reasoning:** \"If you want tomatoes in a month, feed them now\"

-   **Bone meal promotes flower formation** = more fruit sets

### **Long-term Tomato Care**

-   Consider **top dressing with compost** regularly

-   **Shade cloth** can go over tomato trellises if needed

-   **Signs of need:** Lack of new flower formation

## **PEST MANAGEMENT**

### **Argentine Ants - The Major Problem**

**Why they\'re devastating:**

-   **Farm aphids** - move them up plants, \"milk\" them for sap

-   **Eat beneficial insects** - destroy eggs of green lacewing, other predators

-   **Eliminate competition** - have displaced native ant species

-   **Cooperative colonies** - multiple queens, can unite colonies from different locations

**The Scale of the Problem:**

-   **World\'s largest colony:** Lake Wolford (local!) to San Francisco

-   **Top 10 invasive species** globally

-   **Peak activity:** September when temperatures rise

**Limited Solutions:**

-   **Borax solution** available at Grangettos - takes \~1 year to be effective

-   Spencer tried for 2 years, gave up due to time commitment

-   **No natural predators** available

-   **Most affected crops:** Eggplants, peppers, cucumbers, nightshades

### **Voles (Not Gophers)**

-   **Current solution working:** Snap trap on string pulled into tunnel

-   **Spencer\'s method:** Regular mouse traps around hole exits (3-4 traps)

-   **No bait needed** - they walk onto traps naturally

-   **Size:** About the size of field mice

## **COVER CROPS & NITROGEN FIXING**

### **Winter Fallow Option**

If stopping farming in October:

-   **Cover crop blend** from Johnny\'s Seeds - nitrogen-fixing legume mix

-   **Minimum 75 days** needed for nitrogen fixation

-   **Perfect timing:** 90 days available during winter retreat season

-   **Termination methods:** Crimping (no-till) or incorporation

### **Benefits of Cover Crops**

-   **Soil protection** during fallow period

-   **Nitrogen fixation** - pulls nitrogen from atmosphere into soil

-   **Soil health improvement** - organic matter, structure

-   **Alternative:** Black plastic covering if no cover crop

## **MUSHROOM CULTIVATION**

### **Wine Cap Mushrooms - Easiest Start**

**Spencer\'s Success:**

-   **Sees mushrooms within 1 month** of inoculation

-   **Self-propagating** - now appear in places he didn\'t plant them

-   **3+ years** of continuous production from initial inoculation

**Simple Propagation Method:**

1.  Get mycelium from existing wine caps (can harvest from Spencer\'s)

2.  **Black harvest crates** filled with wood chips + mycelium

3.  **Keep moist 2 weeks** in greenhouse/shade

4.  **Crate turns stiff** when colonized = ready to expand

5.  **One bag = four crates** of expanded material

**Integration with Farm:**

-   **Overhead irrigation supports** mushroom cultivation

-   **Daily watering** provides necessary humidity

-   **Under-tree locations** work well with wood chip mulch

## **HARVEST GUIDELINES**

### **Brassica Sizing**

**Simple \"palm rule\":**

-   **Broccoli heads:** Palm-sized or larger

-   **Cauliflower:** Palm-sized, tight heads

-   **Cabbages:** Dense, firm, palm-sized minimum

-   **General rule:** Anything you can cup in your palm is good size

### **Timing Considerations**

-   **Days to maturity increase** as daylight decreases post-solstice

-   **August planting:** 65-75 days to harvest

-   **September planting:** Extends to 85+ days

-   **Winter crops:** Can \"sit still\" in field for extended harvest

## **EQUIPMENT & TOOLS**

### **Irrigation Upgrades**

-   **Impact sprinklers:** Available at Grangettos

-   **Coverage:** 35ft diameter per sprinkler

-   **Spacing:** 2 sprinklers per 75ft row for overhead system

-   **Low pressure options:** 20 PSI operation available

### **Row Preparation Tools**

-   **Broad fork:** Essential for soil incorporation

-   **Scuffle hoe:** Surface cultivation after amendments

-   **General approach:** Minimal tillage, surface working

## **SEASONAL WORKFLOW SUMMARY**

### **Immediate Actions (July-August)**

1.  **Apply nitrogen + compost** to beds for fall planting

2.  **Set up shade cloth system** with 9-gauge hoops

3.  **Plant fall brassicas** under shade protection

4.  **Feed existing tomatoes** with bone meal

5.  **Consider irrigation system evaluation**

### **Fall Transition (September-October)**

1.  **Harvest summer crops** as they finish

2.  **Continue succession planting** cool-season crops

3.  **Prepare for seasonal workforce changes**

4.  **Decide on winter strategy:** continue vs. cover crop

### **Winter Options**

1.  **Continue production:** Cool-season vegetables thrive

2.  **Cover crop fallow:** Nitrogen-fixing legume blend

3.  **Soil protection:** Cover crop or plastic mulch

## **KEY PHILOSOPHICAL APPROACHES**

1.  **\"Always think ahead\"** - Farm for what you want in 1-2 months

2.  **\"Visual confirmation\"** - Systems you can see working are better

3.  **\"Simplicity over complexity\"** - Fewer variables, better control

4.  **\"Work with the seasons\"** - Don\'t fight natural rhythms

5.  **\"Soil nutrition is not optional\"** - Nitrogen inputs are necessary for good yields
