# **Happy Farm Planning & Possibilities**

*Mid-July 2025 - Season Learning & Exploration*

## **OVERVIEW: POTENTIAL TOPICS FOR TEAM EXPLORATION**

*Priority-ordered discussion topics to support farm stability and learning*

### **TIER 1 - IMMEDIATE OPPORTUNITIES (Next 2-4 weeks):**

1.  **Team building and harmonious practice** - Healing, connection, harmonizing working relationships, decision-making flow, other needed supports.

2.  **Community harmonizing** - Creating supportive rhythms for volunteers, monastics, and team members

3.  **Harvest planning and approach**

4.  **Basic weeding approaches** - Gentle maintenance of current plantings while team stabilizes

5.  **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)** - Simple prevention while pest populations are still establishing

6.  **Planting possibilities for available rows** - Only what feels manageable while focusing on team harmony

7.  **Watering Management -** Install new shutoff valve. Find a manageable consistent and appropriate watering management system. Track data. See [***[Happy Farm Watering Info]{.underline}***](https://docs.google.com/document/u/7/d/1AHvS_PYAcXuTj5NUpIjPUyhZvXwGe5iW2q-fdyLUoi0/edit) doc.

8.  **Required soil amendments --** compost teas? Other systems? needed?

### **TIER 2 - NEAR-TERM CONSIDERATIONS (Next 1-3 months):**

5.  **Water system** - getting iron filtration set up

6.  **Soil health exploration** - Understanding our growing medium and gentle amendments

7.  **Seasonal and crop planning** - Looking ahead to fall/winter possibilities, plan volumes of production and harvest times, with good rotations.

8.  **Community and volunteer integration** - Creating sustainable rhythms for participation

9.  **Harvest and post-harvest flow** - Simple systems for processing and sharing produce, working with shoppers and community.

### **TIER 3 - DEVELOPING FOUNDATIONS (3-6 months):**

9.  **Look at Season extension techniques** - do we need to extend growing seasons? shade cloth?

10. **Composting and nutrient cycling** - Thinking about our compost and nutrient cycles

11. **Education, Outreach, Programming** - Sharing experience with retreatants and neighbors, outreach

12. **Deepening core community** - Deepening team resilience and conflict resolution skills

### **TIER 4 - LONG-TERM VISIONING (6+ months):**

13. **Perennial establishment** - Fruit trees, herbs, permanent plantings

14. **Advanced soil building** - Cover crops, polycultures, regenerative techniques

15. **Infrastructure development** - Tool storage, processing areas, permanent structures

16. **Agroforestry integration** - Tree crops, windbreaks, forest garden elements

17. **Retreats and long term practice vision -** what we are offering to and nourishing in the community (Deer Park, Escondido/SD community, SoCal, Local and regional Sanghas, Global MahaSangha)

## **IMMEDIATE PLANTING OPPORTUNITIES** 

## **1. POTENTIAL NURSERY SPACE - EUCALYPTUS GROVE 🌳**

**Opportunity to explore:**

-   The eucalyptus grove could offer natural shade and wind protection for seed starting

-   Could scout for clearings with good morning sun, afternoon shade

-   Simple elevated platform might work well (keeping seedlings above ground due to eucalyptus allelopathy)

-   Basic shade cloth between trees could supplement natural filtering

-   **Note**: Important to keep all seedlings in containers above ground level

**Materials to consider:**

-   Landscape fabric or tarps for ground coverage

-   Simple table/platform materials

-   Shade cloth (30-50%) if needed

-   Seed trays and quality potting mix

### **2. POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR 7 AVAILABLE ROWS**

**Options to consider for mid-July timing:**

## **POTENTIAL 7-ROW POSSIBILITIES**

*Each row: 75 ft x 30\" width - options for team consideration*

### **ROW 1: HEAT-LOVING GREENS & GRAINS (Option)**

**Could explore direct sowing:**

-   **Red Callaloo Amaranth** (dual purpose: greens + grain, educational processing)

-   **New Zealand Spinach** (thrives in heat, easy cut-and-come-again)

-   **Red Russian Kale** (heat tolerant variety)

-   **Small quinoa trial** (Cherry Vanilla - experimental/learning opportunity)

**Gentle approach**: Start small sections, observe what works

### **ROW 2: CANTALOUPE EXPERIMENT 🍈**

**Possibility to try:**

-   **Hale\'s Best Cantaloupe** (75 days, good for learning)

-   **Simple approach**: 3-4 plants spaced generously (18-25 feet apart)

-   **Low pressure**: Let vines do their natural thing, observe and learn

-   **Timing consideration**: Planting now would mean October harvest

**Learning focus**: See how melons perform in our specific conditions

### **ROW 3: ASIAN GREENS EXPLORATION**

**Could experiment with:**

-   **Mizuna** (reported to be heat-tolerant)

-   **Tokyo Bekana** (Japanese variety to try)

-   **Red Giant Mustard** (beautiful and potentially heat-loving)

**Gradual approach**: Maybe try small sections rather than full rows initially

### **ROW 4: HERB & FLOWER OPPORTUNITIES**

**Gentle options:**

-   **Cilantro** (easy to succession plant)

-   **Dill** (tends to self-seed once established)

-   **Nasturtiums** (edible flowers, beneficial insects)

-   **Calendula** (beautiful and functional)

-   **Basil varieties** (always useful for community)

### **ROW 5: QUICK HARVEST POSSIBILITIES**

**Easy wins to consider:**

-   **Daikon radish** (relatively easy, good yield)

-   **Cherry Belle radish** (fast 30-day turnaround)

-   **Hakurei turnips** (both roots and greens)

**Low-stress approach**: Small successions as we learn

### **ROW 6: HEAT-TOLERANT TRANSPLANT OPTIONS**

**Could start in nursery for early August:**

-   **Swiss/Rainbow Chard** (reliable and beautiful)

-   **Heat-tolerant lettuce varieties** (if available)

-   Others?

**Learning focus**: Practice seed starting and transplanting techniques

### **ROW 7: FALL/WINTER PREPARATION**

**Potential for cooler season (do we let rows fallow? Cover crop?)**

-   **Broccoli varieties**

-   **Cabbage options**

-   **Kale for winter**

-   **Garlic?**

**Timeline**: Start seeds soon for late August/September transplanting

## **POTENTIAL TIMELINE FOR DISCUSSION**

### **Near-term Possibilities (Next 1-2 weeks):**

-   **Consider**: Which direct-sow options appeal to the team

-   **Explore**: Setting up simple nursery space if desired

-   **Gentle start**: Maybe begin with 2-3 rows rather than all 7

-   **Learning focus**: Observe what grows well in our specific conditions

### **Early August Considerations:**

-   **If nursery established**: Could transplant any started seedlings

-   **Succession opportunities**: Add more of what\'s working well

-   **Adjust approach**: Based on what we\'re learning

### **Reflections:**

-   **Evaluate**: What\'s working, what feels overwhelming

-   **Fall preparation**: Only if energy and interest support it

-   **Community input**: How are volunteers and community responding?

## **GENTLE CARE CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Watering Approach:**

-   **Daily attention**: New seeds will likely need daily moisture in this heat

-   **Deep watering rhythm**: Established plants might prefer thorough watering every 2-3 days

-   **Morning timing**: Generally easier on plants and reduces disease risk

-   **Mulching**: Heavy mulch can help retain moisture and keep soil cooler

### **Heat Management Ideas:**

-   **Shade cloth**: 30-50% shade during extreme heat waves could help

-   **Row covers**: Temporary protection when temperatures spike

-   **Transplant timing**: Evening planting tends to be less stressful

### **Nursery Space Daily Rhythms:**

-   **Morning check**: Brief walk-through, maybe 5 minutes

-   **Debris awareness**: Keeping eucalyptus leaves swept away

-   **Gentle watering**: Check container moisture levels

-   **Safety awareness**: Watch for falling branches

## **MATERIALS TO CONSIDER**

### **Seeds We Might Explore:**

-   Heat-loving greens (amaranth, New Zealand spinach, heat-tolerant kale)

-   Cantaloupe variety (Hale\'s Best)

-   Asian greens (mizuna, Tokyo bekana, red giant mustard)

-   Herbs (cilantro, dill, basils, oregano, others)

-   Quick crops (radishes, turnips)

-   Heat-tolerant lettuce and chard

-   Fall brassicas (if team wants to try fall growing)

### **Nursery Setup Possibilities:**

-   Ground covering (landscape fabric or tarps)

-   Shade cloth (30-50%) if natural shade isn\'t sufficient

-   Seed trays and containers

-   Quality potting mix

-   Simple hand tools

### **Support Materials:**

-   Mulch for moisture retention

-   Row cover for heat protection

-   Small boards if we try cantaloupe (to protect fruit from ground contact)
