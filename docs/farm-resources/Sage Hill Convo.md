\[Spencer\] Stuff to create the DNA to create the plants, the mass above the soil. Right. And so what you\'re trying to do now is put that back which is with. That\'s why you apply compost. And then. And you\'re not using any type of fertilizers, right? No, no chicken manures or anything like that. It\'s all. Oh, you were for a little bit. I think you were using the 30 spraying some.

\[Ilyas\] There was some fish guts being sprayed. I remember we\'re not doing that anymore.

\[Aaron\] And then we are going to do a compost tea maybe at some point.

\[Spencer\] Maybe 12. 00 with the truford. Yeah.

\[Aaron\] Took it back. We were gonna do it and then it was like pellets and then we took it back.

\[Spencer\] Okay.

\[Ilyas\] We\'re not. Yeah, we\'re no longer doing that either at the moment. We don\'t know if that\'s a good idea or not.

\[Spencer\] Just because you don\'t want to do it or is it like.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, they wanted to do. Our goal, our target is to close loop systems. So actually our humanure will be our full total source of nutrients for the system in the long term. Long term goal.

\[Ilyas\] Different people had different approaches to the farm and like right now this is kind of the full team. And so we don\'t have all the same information maybe that we had. We had before in terms of approaches. We\'re kind of catching up.

\[Aaron\] Completely over.

\[Ilyas\] Yeah, it\'s a lot of information we didn\'t have.

\[Spencer\] So the. What I had shared with the previous team was that to apply the training. True. 1200 which is A. It\'s a nitrogen based fertilizer. I think. I think you could use a little bit. I understand that you want to go closed loop system. I think until you have that you might want to apply a little bit of that if you want to. I understand there\'s like moral and ethic things that you guys don\'t want to.

\[Aaron\] Do which is totally fine. Well we had good success this year without any amendments.

\[Ilyas\] No, we. We were amending. We were amending with this fertilizer.

\[Aaron\] No, no. Is this a bag? Comes in a bag.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, it\'s.

\[Aaron\] No, we took it all back. We didn\'t ever use it. I\'m 100% sure on that.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] I saw Josh on many days over the course of a few weeks. I think applying on that top layer. So it was being applied like these little pellets.

\[Spencer\] It\'s like a brownish not white. It\'s brown.

\[Aaron\] Brown pellets.

\[Spencer\] Organic. It\'s bone meal, fish meal and then.

\[Aaron\] Okay, that\'s Right. We did use a. We did like use a bag or something.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. I mean I was, I saw it there and I told. I even told Nikolai that he needs to work that in. It was applied on the surface. Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] And I was there for that.

\[Aaron\] I. I was good, though.

\[Spencer\] So it is a good.

\[Aaron\] It\'s already in there.

\[Spencer\] You need to reapply if you want to use it going forward.

\[Ilyas\] What I\'m hearing is that you would do this in your own situation and, and maybe. And that your recommendation, like we. We can kind of weigh things out as a team. Your recommendation is to apply this how. How often? What\'s the.

\[Spencer\] If you\'re opening. If you\'re going to retransplant and you have now harvested everything from that bed, you\'re going to want to put back in other than just compost and nitrogen form could be alfalfa, which is 100% alfalfa. Also works Alfalfa meal. Yeah. Which that is. So that has no ethical or moral issues with it. It has no. There\'s no animals were harmed in other than you probably go first and other things and the humans. But so yeah. So the true product is a byproduct of other industries.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, Byproducts. We don\'t. That\'s not so bad for us. I think it\'s more a question of whether we can get away with just using our closed system.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Aaron\] So if we have enough.

\[Spencer\] So you can. But the issue is always going to be where you getting your nitrogen from. And that kind of comes from. I don\'t know. I\'m not. I\'ve never been with Use humanure. The.

\[Aaron\] The nitrogen. A lot of urine. A lot of nitrogen content in the urine. But we could test. We could test out our. Where we\'re at.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, you\'re gonna have to test that and find out where that nitrogen is. Is. Yeah. And do you already have a compost?

\[Ilyas\] Yeah, until September.

\[Aaron\] September. We\'ll have some. But we can test it in September. We have some leftover from. We have that other pile.

\[Spencer\] Run a trial. Let\'s see which one you like better. I\'ve always applied with my compost. Is a. Somewhere important from nitrogen. It could be alfalfa. It could be a bone meal, which is straight. Or you can go with the true product, which is a blend of all three of them, which is great too. Yes, sir. And you\'re using this, the fertilizer, every time. Every time you\'re adding. If you want to put in a new crop, you\'re going to want to put that in before the new crop. How much I would do for your application. Half bucket of a five gallon bucket.

\[Ilyas\] So 2.5 gallons for a full row.

\[Spencer\] Full row, yeah.

\[Aaron\] And we use.

\[Spencer\] We use a full five gallon bucket for 100ft. And what does the product it in. And then you could even. You guys know machinery. Right. Using. So then you can scuffle hoe the.

\[Aaron\] Rest of the scuffle hoe.

\[Spencer\] So broad fork and then that oscillating scuffle hoe the surface and then rake smooth. What you definitely want to do is go the nitrogen. Whatever form of nitrogen and then a compost on top, broad fork, then scalpel hoe.

\[Aaron\] Can we use things like clover and stuff to get nitrogen fixing?

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah, definitely. You definitely can. But the problem is, I mean, yes.

\[Aaron\] Like if we overwinter with clover for.

\[Spencer\] That is you\'re gonna pick up a. A seed from Johnny\'s called. It\'s gonna. It\'s a legume legume blend and it\'s a nitrogen fixing legume blend from Johnny\'s. And it\'s a cover. Cover crop.

\[Aaron\] Yeah.

\[Spencer\] But you\'ll need like 75 days of that crop to do its thing before you can get the cycle right into the soil.

\[Aaron\] But we are thinking about having a fallow season over winter while we have our retreat season. 90 days.

\[Spencer\] That\'s fantastic. So if you do that, I could tell you the cedar you\'re gonna pick up seeds you\'re gonna get. I like cover crops are fun. It should be cool. And there\'s a cool ways of terminating them too where you\'re not using any type of tillage. Okay. You\'re like crimping them and then. But I mean that\'s a huge. When you\'re ready for that, we can go down that rabbit. Okay, that\'s. That\'s another one. Yeah. Okay. I\'ve always loved cover cropping and then using that to your. Your advantage.

\[Ilyas\] What I\'m hearing is that the compost is not enough nitrogen.

\[Aaron\] We have to test.

\[Spencer\] No, I think, I think personally. No.

\[Ilyas\] In your. In your experience. Yeah.

\[Spencer\] From what I saw this year already with you guys when you weren\'t. Because you guys had planted into compost with no nitrogen. And I told Nikolai and Josh you need to apply nitrogen. They didn\'t do it. And then I showed up and within I think a month and the same thing I knew what was going on is that it was yellowing and you weren\'t getting the yield that you should. I don\'t know if you remember the collards. Remember the front row of the collards? Was real big.

\[Aaron\] Real big.

\[Spencer\] And then halfway through the row that was real small. Someone had dropped the bag of nitrogen.

\[Aaron\] Very nitrogen sensitive. Okay, I see. Were super sensitive.

\[Spencer\] Without. Without nitrogen in the row is without basically. And then the front of the row showed what nitrogen does. Okay, that makes sense. And that was. That was totally.

\[Dave\] Remember not knowing what was going on.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. It was like, is it getting more water? Like that makes a lot of sense.

\[Aaron\] We were wondering like we had this lot of variability through our. And that could just be all nitrogen.

\[Spencer\] And so high low tends to spreading nitrogen but not spreading it evenly. So you have like, oh big, big low. And like. So you have crops that are getting it. Crops that aren\'t getting it. Also that could be the drip irrigation too. So I\'ve never personally enjoyed drip because what you have is you have spot irrigation. So wherever it\'s wet is where the roots will travel. But if you have gaps in between moisture, the roots aren\'t going to travel there. And if it grows goes below 3 inches of the most your nutrients is within the top six. If it\'s down below three, the top level is not getting all the nutrients. You can\'t. So the roots aren\'t traveling across the top. That\'s why I\'ve always preferred overhead because now you have complete saturation. Roots have left and right every which direction you go to gather all the nutrition for the plant. So just giving it the best opportunity to grow.

\[Ilyas\] Yeah, I think I just want to like reiterate. You mentioned that if we were to apply the nitrogen, you would apply the nitrogen, put the compost layer on top and then broad fork it and then scuffle. Scuffle hose.

\[Spencer\] So I\'ve always put. I always put nitrogen first. And that\'s because nitrogen is volatile and so it actually will evaporate. The actual atom itself will evaporate. And that\'s why you want to cover it up. So you don\'t want to leave it to the, to the surface the of the air because over time that just goes back up into the atmosphere. But there are plants.

\[Aaron\] It must be UV sensitive because.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, so. And that\'s. But that\'s what\'s cool about the cover crops is you\'re going to plant a crop that is able to pull that out of the atmosphere and put it back into the soil, which is super cool. That\'s.

\[Ilyas\] That\'s what the cover crops taken like nitrogen from.

\[Spencer\] I mean there\'s, it\'s, it\'s a really cool deep dive on that one. That\'s when we get.

\[Aaron\] We\'ll look at can.

\[Spencer\] It\'s all your legumes, beams, peas, all that stuff.

\[Aaron\] Do you guys feel like you have a good feel on row preparation for.

\[Dave\] I just want to share one sort of overarching thing. Like our community shifts the gear at the beginning of October. It goes into a different style of retreat.

\[Spencer\] Sure.

\[Dave\] So we\'re in debate as a farm team, like how we\'re going to move forward in October.

\[Spencer\] Okay.

\[Dave\] So we have questions about like what we could do between now and then because we have fallow rows, like what would be best to throw in and get another crop if. If that\'s a thing. And then I think we\'ll have a separate conversation perhaps another time about like.

\[Spencer\] What we could do so after October.

\[Aaron\] Well, no, I mean one question is we f. We. We put the whole farm on cover crop. We put the whole, the whole. And we could take the whole winter.

\[Spencer\] Off for the winter as an option.

\[Aaron\] As an option. That is an option that I think we should definitely put on the time to go. Ah, so maybe we don\'t. Maybe we do half though.

\[Spencer\] It\'s like this sweet window. You get like spring and reverse and fall. And then like you have these two spots like you have to look at. Like our peak summer is like someone\'s like peak dead winter of snow. Like it\'s so hot here. Like generally right now we\'ve had a very mild winter or summer summer. This has been very calm.

\[Aaron\] Pretty, pretty nice.

\[Spencer\] Like usually in, in July we\'re like 110 already and stuff like that. So I view our, our peak summer as someone\'s dead winter snow where it\'s just like it\'s so hot. You shouldn\'t plant anything right now. You should just like wait a little bit. And then once you get into September, August, August, late late August to September, that\'s when you start planting again and you\'re heading into your fall, which is like spring in reverse. And it\'s. It\'s really kind of you hit this like beautiful sweet spot where it\'s like the temperatures are like right in that perfect 70 degree window and stuff like that. And you have all fun crops coming.

\[Aaron\] In, you know, Are you talking about. So then it\'s October, November, December, three months.

\[Spencer\] So you get three months re harvesting everything you planted in September, August, September, and then you have these.

\[Dave\] So we should be planning now for what we\'re gonna harvest. October, November, December.

\[Spencer\] So right now we are currently planting all of our broccolis, kales, cabbages, cauliflower, all my brassica that I want to harvest through September, October November. I\'m planting right now. Okay. They do well in the heat. They do okay. That\'s the challenge.

\[Aaron\] You gotta shade them, getting them through.

\[Spencer\] The heat, and then once you get them through the heat, you survive. Beautiful, like, beautiful window of like harvest where it\'s. Because what\'s happening too is the sun\'s falling in the sky as we get closer to winter is going down, so the crops start to sit still and so they really slow and stagnant. So you. You get all this planting done and then you have this, this point where you\'re here in November, the sun is continuing to lower till December, and you have crops like cabbages are sitting still in the field, which is. It\'s nice. You have like a slower harvest window and this, like I said, it becomes relaxing. And now you\'re harvesting all your hard work from summer, which is nice. Like you find a rhythm and you\'re of. Kind of going with this rhythm with. With the sun.

\[Aaron\] Can we plant now?

\[Spencer\] Brussels. That\'s a brassica.

\[Aaron\] If we start. So this is basically August, we\'ll say if we planted stuff now, ish. We could harvest in September already.

\[Spencer\] Some stuff.

\[Aaron\] Lettuces, maybe.

\[Spencer\] You start now from seed, you\'re going to count basically 65 to 75 days till harvest.

\[Aaron\] That\'s your two months.

\[Spencer\] Broccoli. Yeah, broccoli, cabbages, collies, things like that. Let me think here. The. And it. And it could extend too. So the later you get, don\'t forget is that. I think when is the solstice? Summer? Whenever. Summer\'s. When\'s the. When the 21st. Yeah. 21st February. September. September. As soon as you hit that point, the sun\'s. I think the sun. The sun is at the peak. No, we\'ve already hit our peak. And now we\'re coming back. Yeah. So we\'re going up. We hit our peak and now we\'re coming back. And the solstice is. That\'s. That\'s basically even day in that. Yeah, correct. Yeah. And that. That is basically showing that like. So we\'ve already started to head down towards winter. And so as you do that, the day length per planting increases. So each. So since we\'re losing hours, the amount of time. So. So if it\'s something 65 days to harvest, that is to bounce to 75. And the longer you wait. So if you plant now in September, that jumps up to 85. It just increases the days to harvest. Yeah. So you deep days to maturity increases. But then it goes in reverse once you go in the spring.

\[Aaron\] I\'m Just wondering if we could plant if we started our a cycle now, could we finish our harvest in October.

\[Spencer\] And then you guys are looking to break in October?

\[Aaron\] I mean, I\'m just, it\'s on the table.

\[Spencer\] Table.

\[Aaron\] Like we have to decide like where we want to stop. We could stop at the end of October. We could plan to stop at the.

\[Spencer\] End of October and then don\'t continue planting. And then you\'ll be done when the harvest is done. Right. Which is always kind of nice too. It\'s kind of like once you harvest last cabbage, you\'re done.

\[Aaron\] That\'s good.

\[Spencer\] But then there\'s the work of turning it over into.

\[Aaron\] And then we have to cover it probably.

\[Spencer\] And it\'s so much more relaxing to work in October than it is. I mean you, this, the temperature is like just spot on. It\'s my favorite. You have this cool breeze like of like this, you know, you don\'t have. Although this has been nice.

\[Luke\] Quick question. When do you harvest broccoli? Like how big?

\[Spencer\] So you\'re looking at like a head like that. I usually go anything that\'s I can palm--- palm size. Same with the cauliflower. Anything you can palm cabbages. Anything that feels dense and tight. And over your palm is good size. General rule for like, like brassica.

\[Aaron\] Nice rule.

\[Dave\] We wanted to ask about our tomatoes too. We got them on those strings, you.

\[Spencer\] Know, are they at the top?

\[Ilyas\] Not all the way.

\[Spencer\] They didn\'t make it all the way.

\[Dave\] They\'re doing great. We\'re getting massive harvest right now. And they\'re healthy.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. Yeah.

\[Dave\] We bought, just bought some shade cloth, but we don\'t know exactly what to do with it.

\[Spencer\] So you\'re gonna, I told trellis over there, Nikolay and Josh are going to put that net over the top of your trellis if as long as your tomatoes are still looking. Are we, are we top dressing with anything compost or anything like that? No. So you, I don\'t know if you want to, you guys, we could need to want to.

\[Aaron\] I, I, we could add compost to it. Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] It would be easy to do.

\[Aaron\] So we could do compost tea.

\[Spencer\] We apply compost. We, we do purchase like a bone meal, which is going to be like a potassium or a potash, which is gonna be good too. That\'s a zero. I think that\'s a 215, like 10 or something like that. What is that?

\[Aaron\] What are those numbers?

\[Spencer\] Those are your nitrogen, potassium and potash npk. Okay, so when you\'re looking at like a fertilizer bag, those are the three Nutrients and generally with tomatoes, I like my last two numbers to be higher.

\[Aaron\] And so what was the number you read off a bow meal and I don\'t remember.

\[Spencer\] 2. 15, 10. 15, 10 maybe, but I don\'t quite remember.

\[Aaron\] Just somewhere.

\[Spencer\] If you look up bone meal, which is the. That\'s the. You want your potassium potash to be high. Next potash is the K. And that\'s kind of interesting with us. Oh, wait, isn\'t the potassium decay. Is it K&PK potash?

\[Aaron\] No, no.

\[Spencer\] Nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus. Maybe you\'re right. Maybe you are right. On the periodic table, K is potassium, right? Yeah, you\'re right.

\[Aaron\] Yeah. Because the other one would be phosphorus, but phosphorus, potassium.

\[Spencer\] You\'re right. You\'re right. I\'m totally wrong. That\'s okay. But I just know my numbers.

\[Aaron\] It\'s all you need.

\[Ilyas\] Potash and potassium should be higher.

\[Spencer\] Correct.

\[Ilyas\] Than the nitrogen, phosphorus.

\[Dave\] And this, this is an addition to the compost and the mushroom compost that we have.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. So we decided I, I would. If you\'re. I mean, how the. Are you getting good yields? Are the tomatoes. Are you losing flowers? Like.

\[Aaron\] Oh, flowers, Flowers. We haven\'t seen a lot of new. A lot of new flowers.

\[Ilyas\] You mean, are the flowers, like sticking around?

\[Spencer\] So, like, are the flowers there? And then they are, you know, they\'re crystaling off or burning.

\[Aaron\] We\'re not getting a lot of new flowers.

\[Spencer\] Okay, so that\'s enough. Yes.

\[Aaron\] So we need inputs.

\[Spencer\] The bone meal will create. Help you create more flowers.

\[Aaron\] Okay.

\[Spencer\] And the flowers are opposite the fruit. And so that\'s, that\'s what you want is. Do you want that?

\[Aaron\] But we might have enough tomatoes because we have like hundreds of pounds of tomatoes coming through. I think still, I mean, wouldn\'t hurt to have more. Well, we have to, we have to process this.

\[Spencer\] We always have to look at the thing is, currently it\'s nice, but what is it going to look like in a month? Yeah, and if you want tomatoes in a month, you should eat it now so that it has tomatoes.

\[Aaron\] Okay. That\'s a good rule.

\[Spencer\] There\'s always, like with farming, kind of like everyone\'s like, oh, I like to be here and now. But in reality you have to be like, what\'s happening in a month or two months from now? And you always have to be looking down the road and not currently, you know, so when I walk around, I look at it like, we got to do this, this and this so that in one month we have this. And that\'s like right now, like I said, like, we\'re planting all of our cabbages because in two months I want cabbages. Right. So you\'re always looking down the road, planning, lots of planning currently, what\'s happening too. Right. Yeah. So right now, what else are you planting aside from. So we did another round of zucchinis. We just did zucchinis. We\'re planting more kale now. All of our, like I said, all of our brassicas. We\'re doing corn. We\'re doing another round of corn right now. Tail end of. I mean, what. How long do the.

\[Aaron\] Our zucchini plants are just like seem to be going? Do they stop at some point or like.

\[Spencer\] So it depends on how hard you\'re picking it. We pick them so hard. I mean we pick every other day. Religious, obviously, that ours tend to peter out. But if you\'re letting you know fruits get big and you\'re not really quite getting to it and they\'re probably going to go for a long time. You could probably have them for the whole season. They\'ll really slow down and they\'ll really start to show problems. Like, they\'ll start to. You\'ll start. No, the fruit will be okay. Yeah, the fruit will deform a little bit. They\'ll start to get like. It\'ll grow along with a point to it. And it won\'t quite look like the classic zucchini. You look to it and that\'s. That\'s kind of for us, that\'s a telltale sign. But like I said, like, we\'re. We\'re looking for aesthetics. Yeah. But we\'re looking for like, does it aesthetically look nice because we got to sell it, you know, things like that. So we\'re looking at things like that. And you guys are looking for just food. Yeah, I mean a lot of it\'s just all edible too.

\[Aaron\] We knew we now have a list from our shoppers of like what they have bought over the past.

\[Spencer\] Oh, good.

\[Aaron\] So we can kind of select from that. Nothing looks of. Kind complicated, I don\'t think in there.

\[Spencer\] But back to this shade net.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, let\'s get that.

\[Spencer\] I think if you find it necessary to. To put it. I would either use it over the tomatoes. If you think you have too much tomatoes be okay, then don\'t put over the tomatoes and maybe put it over since you have it, the next crops you\'re going to plant and use it and save it for that because what you. It\'s a 30. I\'m assuming he bought the same 30. It\'s a 30 shade net.

\[Aaron\] We got 10 by 100.

\[Spencer\] Do you have nine gauge hoops? Any like, any like metal hoops that you could put over the bed?

\[Aaron\] Well, we could get some of that.

\[Spencer\] Is that your.

\[Aaron\] Maybe we should see you have some.

\[Spencer\] Of that in place.

\[Aaron\] We might want to see.

\[Spencer\] It\'s a nine gauge wire. You go to Home Depot, they sell it as a top wire for chain link. Yeah. And then you\'re gonna take. Do you guys have access to like power tools for the grinder? So you can take a grinder and cut that one time in half. So you. Then you\'ll have a. You\'ll have. It\'s a nine gauge completely rolled up tight. You\'re going to cut the bottom or whatever side one time. Don\'t cut it twice because then you have too small of the hoops. You\'re going to cut one time and you have these perfect hoops that are now that you can apply over the beds, which is great. And then you\'re going to run those about every.

\[Ilyas\] They come in a circle.

\[Spencer\] It doesn\'t come. It comes in full circle.

\[Aaron\] And you cut it once.

\[Ilyas\] You can stretch it out.

\[Spencer\] Hoops and you can buy like \$70.

\[Aaron\] Get a couple rows with that.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, you\'ll get a couple rows. I buy two, two rolls of that and cut them. And then you have probably enough to do majority of what you\'re planting, which would be nice. And that\'d be good for like the babies.

\[Aaron\] Somewhat movable. You can like.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, I mean they\'re like little nine gauge

\[Aaron\] Small, easy to move.

\[Spencer\] And then what you\'re going to do is. So now you have your, your hoops and when you go to plant, you\'ll apply those hoops and then use that shade net to cover your plants for the first like two weeks after planting. Keep them covered. Make sure you\'re getting enough irrigation on the transplants and stuff like that. I\'ll. I would use overhead and that\'ll cool off the plants, cool off the net overhead for this.

\[Aaron\] For the new seedlings. Keep them cool, correct?

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah.

\[Aaron\] Couple every.

\[Dave\] Whether we did seedlings or seed.

\[Spencer\] Seed, even seed too. See, because the soil is going to get so hot this month and next month is going to get hopefully ridiculous if it doesn\'t. Then we got a cool weird season. It\'s a cooler season, but it\'s. It\'s going to get crazy hot and we want to just protect your, your labor. So if you\'re putting that stuff in, you might as well just do your due diligence, cover it and then protect it and then that\'ll. You\'re insured to get something from that versus it can get so high it\'ll cook the seeds off and then transplants just really struggle. So everything we plant right now will. We\'ll take a lap before. And everything we plant right now we cover with the shade net.

\[Ilyas\] So this is for like the hot season. Yeah, this is for this month and the shade clothes. So it\'s what Shane cloth and then something else on top.

\[Spencer\] Just, just the shade net and then you\'re running that over the nine gauge.

\[Ilyas\] Okay. And how, how big is this nine gauge?

\[Spencer\] Like. Oh yeah, about that.

\[Ilyas\] Just, just. Oh very, very.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah it\'s a, it\'s, it\'s a one 30 inch bed but like I said when you cut it you\'re going to get like 20, 20 little.

\[Aaron\] Oh, so what do we do with this 10 ft wide? We have to cut it in strips. Yeah.

\[Spencer\] Oh yeah. That if it\'s 10f t wide then you just plant the 10ft wide. Am I, am I missing. Is this the.

\[Aaron\] We have 30 in beds. We have a 10 ft wide shade cloth.

\[Spencer\] I\'m curious where, where you roll it.

\[Dave\] Out over a few different beds.

\[Spencer\] When we walk it\'ll make more sense because I have a large, large net that covers the same thing. So we\'re. So when we have, I have a. Oh several beds. Yeah.

\[Aaron\] Like a big blanket but the hoops go over one row.

\[Spencer\] Correct.

\[Aaron\] I got it and then I got it.

\[Ilyas\] I\'m curious also like where you get your shade cloth from? Johnny\'s.

\[Aaron\] We got the same. We got, we got here, we got your, we got your stuff.

\[Spencer\] And then I can always like if there\'s other questions too and like things.

\[Aaron\] We can get like little detail stuff.

\[Spencer\] Thank you.

\[Aaron\] Do you, how often do you water the, the seedlings go like every other day.

\[Spencer\] Every day transplanting. We\'ll water at least twice a day. Twice, twice a day. At least 15 minutes half hour for about two weeks. Yeah. So if you\'re doing. I would do initial 30 minute in the morning, whatever you do in the morning and then at least two o\' clock just get like maybe 15 to 20 more minutes. And the thing is what\'s difficult and this I highly suggest switching to post transplant overheads and then you can switch back to drip. Is that when you put a plug in the ground it has no extra roots anywhere? Yeah. So you put that plug in the ground. If it\'s not near that, that emitter emitter, there\'s no water getting to it.

\[Aaron\] It\'s not going to die.

\[Spencer\] So you either plant on the emitter or you run overhead and. And then it essentially sends the roots out to the emitter point and then it has water that way. Does that make sense? Not to me but they got it. So basically if you\'re putting a plug in the ground and you\'re running drip lines and then there\'s a gap where there\'s no drip and you have a plug there, that plug\'s not going to live because it has no roots in the soil. So that\'s why you run an overhead irrigation is because that saturates it completely for about two weeks. Gives enough time to send its runners out and then it gets into the other emitters and then it has a chance to pull water itself.

\[Ilyas\] I I wanted to actually talk about this as a topic because I remember on more than one occasion when we talked about doing the drip lines you said you wouldn\'t you. You specifically do not recommend it. You went down that path. You don\'t you that you use overhead irrigation. That it\'s better that that and I What\'s your main. What\'s your I\'m curious consideration because we\'ll have to replace. Replace the system. It sounds like next year anyways or many people would and it\'s getting clogged easier.

\[Spencer\] You know dealing with the like the lines in the row. It\'s less plastic. If you\'re looking at waste. It\'s way less plastic to run it overhead you eventually I\'m surprised you haven\'t run into issues like with squirrels or anything trying to eat it. You might run into the issue now as it gets a little and then you\'re spending more time fixing that than you are farming. That\'s why what I\'ve always found is I found it\'s. And then you\'re buying more plastic to replace that plastic and it\'s constant like this reoccurring circle. People go it\'s water wise, it\'s safe. But if you\'re pulling from a well I mean yeah it\'s already you\'re pulling from something that\'s giving back to the earth that\'s probably going back down into that same reservoir and coming back up, you know. So I think it\'s okay to run overall I think it\'s a better system to run an overhead because you can visually see see that everything\'s being saturated. It\'s a like a visual confirmation. They have low pressure emitter low pressure overhead that we even use that is like text takes like 20 psi to operate a real wide spray which is nice too. So when you\'re ready to Switch to overhead. I can give you all the information on overhead. Okay. And it\'s. It\'s just. I don\'t know, it\'s just way better. I. I like it cools off the plant cools. Cools plants, cools the surface of the soil, which is nice. And then like I said too, when you transplant, you\'re not worried about like, pulling the drip tapes back out or sending them back out and then being.

\[Ilyas\] Like, this one\'s gone in the sun. They\'re moving all the time, every single day.

\[Aaron\] Lots of very intensive labor.

\[Spencer\] Hoeing. You\'re working around it and like, shoot, I cut one. And you\'re like, no, I gotta fix it. And then the thing is too, is if you cut a line and you don\'t get it fixed and is leaking, then the entire row that is all linked to that one line is compromised. So not just that row, but you have like four beds linked to that one, and that line\'s cut. These are not getting adequate pressure because there\'s more water running out of this cut.

\[Ilyas\] We have one leak near the cucumbers, and that could actually be affecting the water in the entire system.

\[Spencer\] 100. And that means the rest are not getting the amount of pressure needed. And so you\'re. If you\'re running at the same time, that means it\'s not. These are definitely the ones that this. If there\'s a cut here, the one out here is definitely not getting enough water. 100%.

\[Ilyas\] I\'m curious about water schedule. We\'ve been playing around with that, and we. Right now we\'re doing like 40 minutes every three days,

\[Aaron\] 50 minutes.

\[Spencer\] Oh, wow. That is okay. Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] I don\'t know.

\[Spencer\] So my issue is I have. I mean, we run water straight down.

\[Aaron\] Okay.

\[Spencer\] The water definitely moves through our soil. Also want a new pasture. Just really kind of cool is where you can see how the water is traveling under. Under the earth and stuff like that. But yeah, it\'s cool. You have. We have like, irrigation running up top, no irrigation running down below. But there\'s a green patch of. Of corn growing. And I\'m like, corn\'s really notorious for deep diving for. For water and stuff like that. And so you see this green patch. But anyways, water schedule. I water every day for 30 minutes every morning. And then with like, tomatoes, things like that, I\'m watering twice a day.

\[Ilyas\] And that\'s not even through drip. That\'s through even more overhead irrigation.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. But I\'m every day, every single day for 30 minutes. Okay. I\'m surprised you guys can get away with every three.

\[Ilyas\] I think it\'s been doing it for a week.

\[Aaron\] No, we definitely can because of the moisture. It\'s. The drip is very deep. It\'s deep watering.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Aaron\] We don\'t lose it. We lose almost nothing to evaporation.

\[Spencer\] That\'s great. The problem is, though, so right now it\'s good. You have established crops. Once you have.

\[Aaron\] We have to switch. We might need both systems. We might want to try both.

\[Spencer\] So once you have. You have established crops. Have, like a deep root, taproot, everything like that. So it\'s able to get the water. Yeah, and the water sounds like it\'s staying within the compost, which is good. So you have a lot of organic matter. But now when you go to replant, if you have it every three days, you definitely.

\[Aaron\] That won\'t work. Won\'t work for replanting.

\[Spencer\] Not. Not wet enough. Oh, yeah. Replant. Yeah.

\[Aaron\] Yeah.

\[Spencer\] So you want. You can. You could keep that same drip, but you want to do is just switch the overhead for at least two weeks.

\[Aaron\] For two weeks.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. Yeah. But then be aware that if you have drip lines pulled out and you have overheads run out. Pulled out, that you\'re running two different irrigations at the same time. There\'s a lot. A lot of irrigation happening at once. So pull one or the two off. So pull drips out, run the overheads.

\[Ilyas\] We don\'t have.

\[Aaron\] Over.

\[Ilyas\] Yeah, yeah, we don\'t have. We have. We have like, a single sprinkler. I\'m curious. Is there.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. So you could buy in. I\'ll show you some new. I\'ll show you an impact. You remember the stands I brought that one time with the green stands I had.

\[Ilyas\] We use those.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] We have, I think, one or two of them.

\[Spencer\] Good. Yeah, Those. Those are. Are they mine? They might be yours.

\[Aaron\] Oh, yeah. We have your.

\[Ilyas\] We have your sprinklers.

\[Aaron\] Those were attached to a hose.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah, yeah. It would be good. Oh, wait, wait, no. Is it the one that spins or is it, like an impact? So it\'s a slap.

\[Ilyas\] Three green.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] Holes. And it\'s.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah, yeah. So those. So I bought those at Grangettos. You could probably get them there, too. They\'re. They work great in that. You could probably put two, and the two would cover your 75ft perfectly.

\[Ilyas\] For one. For one.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] Two per lane.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Ilyas\] For the. Specifically for the. For the transplant.

\[Spencer\] Transplants. And those are going to shoot 35ft. What is that straight? So this. If this is the center of it, you\'re Gonna go whatever half of 35 is. Is that, like.

\[Aaron\] I think that I wanna pause us. Because we can figure out a lot of this stuff, and a lot of the information is already known by Nikolai. So I just want to come circle back to our list.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah.

\[Aaron\] If that\'s all right. And check out if there\'s. I just want to field with you guys to see if there\'s priority stuff. There\'s pests on our lists.

\[Spencer\] There\'s gopher hawks.

\[Aaron\] Hang on. Let me just review the stuff that we have on our list so then we can decide. Because we don\'t have tons of time. We put succession planting on there. We talked a bit.

\[Spencer\] Little.

\[Aaron\] Little bit about that already, like, planning out. I think we asked about what types of crops we can grow. You already told us a little bit about what you\'re doing. We can also follow on that. We got when to harvest. About sizing. We had a question in there about mixing stuff together. Like someone we don\'t. We don\'t know exactly who\'s doing stuff on our farm. Yeah, we need a little more oversight. But someone put green bean vines in with our eggplants or with eggplants. So we think it might be good. That\'s a question. Let\'s see, the other. I think really important to me, I mean, is. And so is finding out if we can do small numbers of seedlings. Because, like, I know you have these trays with 128. And for us, for lettuce, like, 30 head of lettuce is, like, great for two weeks. That\'s two weeks of lettuce, you know?

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Aaron\] So I don\'t know if there\'s a way we could, like, share with you or tape or get. Buy you a smaller seeder tray or something. That\'s a question mark.

\[Spencer\] That means with my seed gal, which is my sister.

\[Aaron\] Yeah.

\[Spencer\] Let me. Let me ask her what she. What is the best approach for that, about doing a smaller one? Because I knew that was a thing. And what I tried to do with Nikolai and Josh was that what was easier for me, because what they were trying to do was tell me I need a quarter to three quarters of a bed. And then I was having to spend time, like, calculating.

\[Aaron\] No, we don\'t want to do that. We\'re going to tell you the number of seedlings we want.

\[Spencer\] So what I. What I told him would be better to order by the tray and then buy the tray. But then if we could find a.

\[Aaron\] A smaller tray.

\[Spencer\] Smaller tray or something that was a little bit. Or.

\[Aaron\] Or even go quarter divide, Divide the tray up into quarters.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. So like you wanted X millet lettuce and then we could split one single train. That\'s easier that way.

\[Aaron\] That would work.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, but let\'s.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, I know that. I just wanted to cover all the topics.. The last two on here are seedlings we could take. Now if you had extras you could share with us and then about a greenhouse. I don\'t know. Among those things that I named, are there things you guys want to prioritize in terms of getting info for me?

\[Spencer\] I\'m thinking because we, we\'re, we\'re kind of against sneaky plants, which is what we\'ve been calling co planting. Yeah. But just because it\'s like confusing, hard to keep track of. But I\'d be curious if you have any insights there. I, I as a, I think a small scale they call it partner planting or co planting. I think it\'s sneaky plant vacation. I think it\'s nice, it\'s fun, it\'s. But there\'s definitely like certain plants and it\'s not because they go well with each other, but I just like certain crops to go with each other. So like if I\'m doing, let\'s see here, I\'ll do like a long term crop with a short term crop. So I\'ll do. If I\'m co planting, so I\'ll do or partner planning, I\'ll do like a kale and then on the sides of the kale I\'ll do something that I\'m going to pull out one time. Time. And so that way I\'m not coming back to this bed and continuously harvesting. I\'ve now got two harvests from a single bed. Good enough for me. So if I do a kale, I\'ll do like a, a red radish on the side of it and then that way I can come back, pull the red radish out. That gives way for the kale to grow into its full life. And then, and now you\'ve got two harvests from one bed while you wait for one.

\[Aaron\] But if we\'re not worried about space or time maximization, things we can just stick to.

\[Spencer\] I, I don\'t, I don\'t.

\[Aaron\] There\'s no advantage, right.

\[Spencer\] Do it. Once we got large enough where I was comfortable enough, I don\'t do it anymore because I just find it, it\'s, it\'s complicated. Sometimes things grow over each other and it gets messy. It\'s annoying. And I much rather keep. This is my row of radish. This is my ro Kale you know, and so like. Or you know, vice versa too with, you know, other things. I\'ve always kept them. I\'d like them separate. And it\'s just better. It\'s organized, you know, and then pests.

\[Dave\] Yeah, that\'s my.

\[Ilyas\] We have lots of ants. I don\'t know if we have to worry about that. And we have tons of ants around. Like the eggplants.

\[Spencer\] Oh. The most populated animal on the planet. Top 10 to watch species. It\'s my favorite. I\'m going to deep dive on Argentinan ants.

\[Ilyas\] Some of the lettuce is actually rotting as well, I think. And. And so there\'s lots of flies in addition to that. We have like green kind of.

\[Spencer\] I don\'t know.

\[Ilyas\] I don\'t know what kind.

\[Spencer\] We have black flies. Really bad right now. This is the most I\'ve ever had them.

\[Ilyas\] Okay.

\[Aaron\] Cuz it\'s been cool.

\[Spencer\] It\'s been cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They\'re like little black. They\'re the ones that flying us around us right now. They\'re like the worst I\'ve ever had them. This. This year. Like about a month ago, I was like, holy. It\'s like a pandemic. It was so many. When you walk through the field, you. Yeah, it\'s crazy. Black flies. I\'m not too sure or anything to do. Flies don\'t that generally bother me. Flies are flies. The ants answer a problem. Ants. I wouldn\'t, I wouldn\'t have pass issues on my farm without the Argentine ant. Argentina is notorious for farming aphids. What they do is they move the aphids up, up plants and they milk the SAP off their backs and then they continue moving them. And then what the other negative thing about Argentina. Go ahead.

\[Ilyas\] A lot of the leaves have like holes in them just, just like bitten through all the way. Like all the collards, all the eggplant as well.

\[Spencer\] Snails. What about caterpillars? Caterpillar. Caterpillars probably have caterpillars too.

\[Ilyas\] Small holes like, like, like this little spots like that. Yeah, spots. That\'s the eggplants. Every leaf on the eggplant is spotted like that.

\[Aaron\] But I, I think we have no issue with holes in our plants.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

\[Aaron\] So we\'re just interested in pests that are gonna kill plants.

\[Spencer\] You kind of have to run with it and it\'s just gonna be. That\'s your nemesis. That\'s my nemesis. There is or there is a solution where they sell at Grand Jettos. It\'s a, A borax solution where the ants actually go up and drink it, it takes about a year to work. Oh wow. But at this point we kind of just let them rip. You know the answer. They, they have their season, they go away. It is the number one nuisance.

\[Aaron\] What do they do to you guys?

\[Spencer\] They just target, they just move the aphids. So everything that can attract an aphid, the Nebraska, things like that, the ants move it up in. The other issue is, is the ants will also eat your beneficial insects. So when I tell you that like it\'s a, it\'s a big problem. It\'s a big problem having arts and like there\'s a reason why it\'s on the top 10 watch species list on the world. I mean, I don\'t. Do you know that the largest colony, where it starts and goes from, since you knew a little bit about it, largest colony starts at Lake Wolford and then goes to San Francisco in the world.

\[Ilyas\] That\'s crazy.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, right. And the next one is in Spain. What I\'m like, I mean when you\'re here, I mean on my phone, I swear I was like, I think the start point was here. But you guys have it too. But it can get really bad and the hotter it gets, the more prolific they get. They, they dominate other, other ants. So we used to have red ants, black ants, like larger black ants. Those are all gone now. The art, I mean if you look into Argentina, you find out why they\'re on the top 10 watch list, but there\'s not much you can do about it. You can do a borax solution. It takes time. I gave, I did it for about two years. I saw it work and then I gave up within that year. I saw it work and then didn\'t repeat it and do it again because I didn\'t know it worked until the next year. Oh, it just takes time to do it. But there\'s just. I can let you know that if you want to go with that solution or you just let them rip.

\[Aaron\] So the, the minus for you is you get, you get a reduced yield on your crop. Does it take, does it kill plants?

\[Spencer\] So any of your, your peppers. The issue is what they\'re also doing is they\'re also eating the beneficial insects. So anything that is like beneficially eating other negative insects for you, they\'re consuming their eggs. And so, so we\'ve used to buy like green lace, green lace larvae that would come on a sticker with the eggs and the ants decimate all them and just eat them. It\'s just like.

\[Aaron\] So you don\'t get your beneficials.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah.

\[Aaron\] Gotcha.

\[Spencer\] So, I mean, there\'s that other pests. I don\'t know if you guys run into gophers or squirrels.

\[Aaron\] We need something that likes Argentine ants.

\[Spencer\] Like, there\'s not one. I\'ve looked into it. I mean, if you do know, know, let me know. Everybody says the Borax solution. I mean, it\'s cool. It\'s getting the anteater in there. I mean, it is kind of a cool concept not to go any further into it, but like the Argentina, which is really interesting, is that they can. You can take a colony from Hawaii and. Or ants from Hawaii and drop it off here in San Diego. And if you introduce them together, they\'ll be like, oh, brother. Like, welcome. But if you do that with any other species, they\'ll actually come back and fight each other. Like they, they don\'t know who they are. Cooperative. Yeah, exactly. And what\'s really interesting too is the Argentina doesn\'t have a. They don\'t have a singular queen. They have like every 100 or plus ants, maybe more. They have a new queen. And so they have. It\'s like a democracy. It\'s really interesting. They have multi queens.

\[Aaron\] That\'s why they\'re taking over.

\[Spencer\] Traveling with them. I mean. Yeah. This is fascinating. Yeah. And they came over here.

\[Aaron\] Okay. So that\'s our.

\[Spencer\] As we started becoming global. The global economy. They hopped on boats and they came across like, I will be watching. I will be watching a YouTube video. Yeah. It\'s actually pretty interesting. But the.

\[Dave\] Yeah, so we had bowls.

\[Ilyas\] We do have two.

\[Dave\] And they went away for a while. And now that we took this two weeks that we weren\'t there for a lot, a lot of time, now they\'ve come back.

\[Spencer\] So go for hawks. If it\'s bulls. The, the, the problem with voles is that go hocks don\'t necessarily work. They kind of go around it. You can use snap traps.

\[Aaron\] I don\'t know if we were using your technology.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah. The go.

\[Aaron\] No, you. Whatever you have that\'s like on a. It\'s like on a wire. It\'s like some kind of snap trap on a. And they had it on a. On a piece of line or something.

\[Spencer\] I don\'t know. So snap trap on a lot. The only thing I read was a. Was a go for a hawk. And that was the only thing I recommended. What\'s that really for a bull? Yeah, yeah, but, but I was recommending for gophers. I didn\'t really recommend anything for bulls.

\[Aaron\] I thought. Because Nikolai told me he talked to you about what to do for this particular animal. And it was like a. Put something. Put the trap in the tunnel and it has like a stake and then it\'s like tied on a line. Oh, that\'s not.

\[Ilyas\] You mean you catch you, you. You like.

\[Aaron\] No, it\'s.

\[Spencer\] No, ours is a Gopher Hawk, which is a basic snare trap on a tube that you push through with a spring loaded.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, I know.

\[Spencer\] And they went through and it snapped up. So he.

\[Aaron\] You\'re not the one who told them about this other system.

\[Spencer\] I don\'t know what that is.

\[Aaron\] Oh, okay. Well, he\'s there is. I\'ll have to ask Nikolai about that.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. What you could do for. Go for. For bowls though is use a basic like mouse snare.

\[Aaron\] That\'s what it is. Yeah, it\'s a snap if you have a.

\[Spencer\] If you have a hole.

\[Aaron\] You see where the bo put it in the hole?

\[Spencer\] Yeah, we don\'t put in the hole but you put it around it. So you put three or four around it so it comes out.

\[Aaron\] The way they. The way they\'ve done it is they put the nippy. They put this trap on a string and pull it through into the tunnel. So that\'s hanging out in the tunnel. It seems to work really well.

\[Spencer\] If it works, go with it.

\[Ilyas\] Well, but you use what just for. For informational purposes.

\[Spencer\] Basic mouse.

\[Ilyas\] Just like a mouse.

\[Spencer\] Yeah.

\[Aaron\] Outside of the hole putting like four.

\[Spencer\] Of them around it so it comes out.

\[Dave\] What do you bait it with?

\[Spencer\] Just. No, they come out. They walk right onto it. I don\'t really bait it with anything. I used to. Peanut butter got over that and they just let the like common and just.

\[Ilyas\] Big enough for a mouse. Like a small.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah. I mean for. Bulls are like that big. They\'re basically a field mouse. But they go on the ground.

\[Aaron\] Yeah, I feel good on. I mean the pests are not. I think the ants is the main one with the voles. We\'re not seeing them pulling any plants.

\[Spencer\] You\'re really going to see the ants like when they really decimate crops. It could be your. It\'ll be your eggplants, it\'ll be your peppers, it\'ll be cucumbers and it\'ll be.

\[Aaron\] Yeah.

\[Spencer\] Most of your night shades are going to get decimated by ants because what they\'re going to do, they\'re just going to go the town on the aphids and stuff like that and. And then it\'s going to go hardcore on your. Wow.

\[Aaron\] Well, I feel like we did a pretty.

\[Spencer\] It\'ll be like September.

\[Aaron\] Okay.

\[Ilyas\] And I. I I wanted to touch base you mentioned. So one option is maybe we, we could set things up harvest wise in order, schedule wise in order to just finish by October or November. And I\'m curious like okay, what are like what are the broad 10,000 foot kind of options from there there? Is it like okay, maybe cover crops through, through the winter? Like what would we do?

\[Spencer\] Ideally you want to, if you\'re not going to be farming it, you just set the soil up for health. You want to do a cover crop, you definitely want to put a cover crop down and that\'ll protect. Or put some kind of black plastic that\'ll cover the soil. That\'ll protect it that way too.

\[Ilyas\] And then, but another, another option could be if, if the team is in a place to, to continue working there. It would be what, like planting for through the winter as well?

\[Spencer\] Yeah, yeah.

\[Aaron\] Winter is a great season too.

\[Spencer\] I imagine you\'re basically just going to continue planting the same stuff. Yeah, I mean more, more all your fun like winter stuff. So all your cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, mushrooms.

\[Aaron\] This is when we should do our mushrooms.

\[Spencer\] No pump better.

\[Ilyas\] What mushrooms will you need to do in the next month?

\[Spencer\] Yeah, mushrooms are a fun one. What kind of mushroom you trying to do?

\[Ilyas\] All of that. I\'ve been trying to spearhead like a mushroom thing and make mushrooms a part of the farm.

\[Spencer\] Have you tried the, the red wine yet?

\[Ilyas\] I. That\'s what I want to do on the, on the bed. On one or two beds are fun.

\[Spencer\] As soon as you put those things in the ground, you\'ll see. Within a month you\'ll see wine caps.

\[Ilyas\] Here in this kind of. How do you keep the humidity?

\[Aaron\] Cuz you\'re watering every day.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, I water every day. Day. And then if you put them on trees. Yeah. And I have overhead irrigation and so with the wood chips. So we\'ll put them underneath the trees and then like I mean I\'ve had to put wine caps in and now see them within a month. Sorry. No, you\'re good. I now have wine caps for the last like three years and they just pop up wherever and now they\'re in places I didn\'t put them, which is cool.

\[Aaron\] So that\'s awesome.

\[Spencer\] You can always throw down wine caps. Experiment with it. Throw down.

\[Ilyas\] I\'m trying to inoculate my own, my own sawdust bags. Basically I\'m doing like from, from scratch.

\[Spencer\] Be that like just get some wine caps.

\[Ilyas\] Do you have wine caps?

\[Spencer\] If we walk around I could find some.

\[Ilyas\] Cuz I would love to get one just to. I can clone the.

\[Spencer\] I mean, it\'s so, like, you don\'t even have to seed the wine cap. You can grab the mycelium from the soil.

\[Aaron\] And then we have my. We have my wine cap mycelium in our. In our tomato beds.

\[Spencer\] Black harvest crates, those black things. And I fill it with witches, put it in my greenhouse house, and then just wet it for the next, like, two weeks. Yeah, wet it for the next two weeks. And you see the entire crate turn hard, like, stiff.

\[Ilyas\] What are you putting into the crate?

\[Spencer\] The mycenium. And just wood chips.

\[Ilyas\] And wood chips.

\[Spencer\] Okay.

\[Aaron\] Yeah.

\[Spencer\] Just be careful. I don\'t. I like. I like messing with them. Sorry. So, yeah, just put the myceum in the wood chips in the crate, and then I put it in, like, a greenhouse or a shady spot. Just keep it moist for the next, like, two weeks.

\[Ilyas\] And then expand. Expand that.

\[Spencer\] Oh. And then that. That becomes your whole. And then you could take that. And then you have more.

\[Ilyas\] More buckets.

\[Spencer\] Yeah. I mean, you basically have one. They send you a bag like this. Yeah. You take that bag and make it into, like, four crates, and then you have four crates that go. And then you actually will get mushrooms from that crate, too. Yeah. Which is cool.

\[Aaron\] I think we should maybe pause here and maybe look at the shave claw. We\'re already 11:30, so.

\[Ilyas\] Awesome.

\[Dave\] Amazing.

\[Spencer\] Yeah, it\'s. It\'s.
