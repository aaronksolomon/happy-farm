This sprouting broccoli produces ample amounts of side shoots when plants are spaced 12–18"" apart. For a single crop harvest, space plants 6–8"" apart. Pinching not necessary. CULTURE: Prefers a well-drained, fertile soil high in organic matter with a pH of 6.0–7.5. Prefers a consistent supply of moisture throughout the growing season. Irrigate regularly for best results. TRANSPLANTING: Sow 2 seeds per cell in 72-cell plug flats, 3–4 seeds/in. in 20-row flats, or in outdoor beds ¼"" deep. Seedlings should be ready to transplant in 3–4 weeks. If possible, keep soil temperature 75–85°F (24–29°C) until germination, then reduce air temperature to about 60°F (16°C). Ensure good air circulation and light. DIRECT SEEDING: Sow 2–3 seeds/ft., ½"" deep, rows 18–36"" apart, thinning to same plant density noted in transplanting recommendations. INSECT PESTS AND DISEASE: Prevent flea beetle damage by applying floating row cover at planting. Flea beetles can also be controlled with insecticides such as azadirachtin or pyrethrin. Cabbage worms can be controlled with Bacillus thuringiensis. Prevent disease with crop rotation and good sanitation. CROP MAINTENANCE: For some varieties, side-shoot production can be increased by pinching the initial head as soon as it forms. HARVEST: Before flower buds open, cut stems of central head and side shoots. Stems 4–8"" in length can be bunched for sale or sold loose. Harvest side shoots every 2–3 days in warm weather and every 5–7 days in cool weather to encourage continued production.",success,2025-12-24T11:20:49.788686

Big plants are late to begin bearing, but then yield consistently over a long picking period. Best picked small, 4-5"" long; larger fruits will have a bumpy appearance. USDA Certified Organic. Culture: Fertile, well-drained soil with a pH of 5.8–6.8 is best. Plastic mulch and fabric row covers (AG-19 grade) can aide plant establishment and exclude insect pests during the seedling stage; row covers should be removed when plants begin to flower. Poor fruit development may indicate insufficient pollination. For highest quality fruit, succession plantings every 2-3 weeks may be needed. Plant spacing: Space plants 18-24"" apart in rows 6' apart; wider spacing may allow for easier harvesting. Diseases: Common cucurbit diseases include powdery mildew, downy mildew, bacterial wilt, and phytophthora—avoid problems with adequate soil drainage, good air flow, insect pest control, and crop rotation. Insect pests: Cucumber beetles, squash bugs, and vine borers are common; protect young plants with floating row cover. Control notes: squash bug eggs may be crushed by hand; for vine borers, cut out vines and hill soil over the wound; keep field borders mowed and remove plant refuse in the fall; pyrethrin sprays may offer some control. Harvest fruit regularly 2-3 times a week once plants produce; for summer squash harvest at about 4-6""; handle with care to avoid scratching fruits. Harvest blossoms in mid to late morning when fully open, clipping flowers 1-2"" below flower base; if a fruit crop is desired, harvest only male blossoms, leaving some to pollinate females. Storage: Keep fruit at 40-50°F (5-10°C), 95% relative humidity for up to 2 weeks. Days to maturity: from direct seeding (subtract about 14 days if transplanting).

A clear favorite in Johnny's taste tests. Extra sweet. No need to add sugar when cooked. Very good yields of uniform, blunt-ended roots in a very concentrated set. Excellent storage potential when cured properly. An exclusive selection developed over 20+ years by organic grower John Mahon. Despite the name, this variety is a sweet potato, not a yam. Plant Patent #20,666. USDA Certified Organic. SCIENTIFIC NAME: Ipomoea batatas. CULTURE: Sweet potatoes grow best in well-drained, sandy loam soil with a pH of about 6.5. You will receive bare-root slips. The slips may be dry, wilted, pale or brown in color when they arrive—this is normal. Slips may or may not have visible roots. A lack of visible roots does not negatively impact viability or yield. If planting must be delayed, wrap the root end of the slips in moist paper towels, keeping the leaves and stems dry. Place upright and keep at room temp., out of direct sunlight and wind. Plant out as soon as danger of frost has passed, and soil temp. is at least 60°F (16°C). In cold regions, black plastic mulch may help to warm the soil and is recommended. Plant slips 3-4"" deep in raised beds 10-18"" apart in rows 36-60"" apart. Keep well-irrigated until plants are established. INSECT PESTS: Sweet potatoes are usually free from major insect infestations, but problems may arise from flea beetles, Japanese beetles, wireworms, and sweet potato weevils (in Southern US). DISEASE: Avoid diseases such as scurf with crop rotation and by removing all plant debris after harvest. HARVEST: Dig roots in fall before hard frost and before soil temps. drop to 50°F (10°C). If plants get frosted, harvest as soon as possible—frost damage will travel from the plants down into the roots, and affect storage quality. STORAGE: Brush soil from roots and cure in a warm 85°F (29°C), dark, humid (85% RH) and well-ventilated place for 4-7 days to toughen skin. Store at 60° (16°C), in a dark, humid place and avoid unnecessary handling.",success,2025-12-24T11:23:25.353348
